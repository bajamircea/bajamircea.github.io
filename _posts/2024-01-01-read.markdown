List of books I've read in 2024


- 2024-01-25 Alan Turing: "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (Mind, October 1950)
: Interesting. It describes the imitation game: can a machine impersonate a
human for a dialogue? The article is better at debunking common incorrect
arguments for the negative answer, but quite visionary for the time is was
written.

- 2024-01-24 Rob Eastway and Jeremy Wyndham: Why do buses come in threes?
: Easy maths puzzles book. Children like it.
