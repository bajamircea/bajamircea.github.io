- 2023-08-15 Stephen Cole Kleene: Introduction to Metamathematics (Ishi Press: 2009 reprint)
: This was a 3 years+ marathon, one of the most difficult books I've read. The
reason I persisted is that it was also full of ideas. The book captures the
developments in mathematical logic, particularly in the 1930s to 1950s,
particularly with questions "What can be proved?", "What can be calculated?". I
started reading it out of interest around GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem.
Compared with many other books, Kleene's has rigour both in terms of proofs and
in terms of philosophical ideas about the assumptions made (e.g. the clearest
explanation of the intuitionist/constructivist ideas). That helped me be more
rigorous myself and develop my own ideas about numbers, reasoning and
computing. I wish the bound vs.  free variables was better explained and that
the choice of postulates was done earlier (rather than at the end of the book).
10 out of 10, though it's not for everybody.

- 2023-08-11 R. Sedgewick and K. Wayne: Algorithms, online course on Coursera (Partt I and II)
: I enjoyed the online course (free on Coursera at the moment). It was doable
in a few months of evening and occasional weekend study. It's less verbose than
the book, though the book might be interesting for details. It uses Java. At
least it uses a sane subset of Java and warns about wrong choices of the
language. I liked that it does not ignore engineering issues. Memorable ideas:
  - the explanation how to design graph algorithms to not have to mutate the
    graph structure.
  - "we thought we understood red black trees in the 70s": related to the
    design of left leaning reb black trees in the early 2000s so that deletion
    is easiser to implement
  - the idea that approximating complexity often suffices, rather a complete
    precise description
  - dealing with ideas of P vs. NP at the end of the course, the saner overview
    I've seen to date
  - There are all sort of usages of algorithms, e.g. for a search that returns
    "found" even if the searched entry is not present (albeit with low
    probability) is acceptable for some problem domains (though totally
    unacceptable in other domains)
  - I came to realise that "interview questions" are often taken from books
    like this and are of academical interest rather than applying to the job
    the interview is for
  - the programming assignment were automatically graded. Did not accept
    anything other than 100 out of 100. Found that I was getting better at
    getting the max score due to familiarity with the expectations (e.g. work
    done in constructor, use of memoisation was expected to reach performance
    requirements) without really being a much better programmer.
  - found that Java is poor of supporting abstractions compared with C++,
    resulting in a programming style that often used larger classes, but
    sometimes because of the constraints, I would make better choices e.g. two
    arrays instead of an array of structures resulting in better space (no
    padding) driven from attempts to avoid silly Java memory allocations

- 2023-04-12 Herbert A. Simon: Reason in Human Affairs
: Accidental repeat read of the book (first read it in 2018). This time I
thought it was really great. 10 out of 10. It's short: 3 chapters. The first
chapter introduces a description of the process involving human rationality
which is that, other than processes that we handle subconsciously like
breathing, we handle problems one by one in isolation, we generate
alternatives, we stop at the first acceptable alternative (not necessarily the
optimal one). This is similar to Kahneman's system 1 and 2 model. He's got an
idea that this approach works in a mainly empty word where most of the time we
only need to deal with one problem. Chapter 2 talks more about evolution and
how such way of reasoning arises. He spends some time on selfishness vs.
altruism and hits quite a few points on "survival of the fitter, not the
fittest", on ecological niches, on the way variations are created. This chapter
alone was more inspiring than the whole "The Selfish Gene" book. Chapter 3
looks at what it means for the way society is structured, politics, markets and
what can be expected to be sorted by human reason.

- 2023-04-07 Philip A. Fisher: Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings
: Interesting book on investment. The introduction to the book by the son of
the author is worth half of the book (in terms of giving an insight on how the
author really was and the effects of old age and isolation). The interesting
part in the book was the focus on long term company growth and the insights
into the required qualitative investigation to identify such stocks, which is a
good complement to Benjamin Graham's "Intelligent Investor"
