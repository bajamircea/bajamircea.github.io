List of books I've read in 2019


- 2019-07-07 Rose George: Nine Pints
: Book about blood. Journalistic style. OK, but not great.

- 2019-06-18 Wilfrid Hodges: Logic - an introduction to elementary logic
: The good parts: samples of English sentences that are ambiguos (hence the
difficulty of translating them in formal logic) and examples with solutions.
The bad parts: not clear and precise where it should be. E.g. first-order
predicate logic might be the crowning achievement of modern logic, but stating
this sheds little light on what is first-order predicate logic. Also too much
time spent on the tableaux method.

- 2019-06-07 Kurt Gödel: On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems
: This 1962 translation by B. Meltzer comes with an introduction by R. B.
Braithwaite. The introduction is not good. The actual paper is difficult, but
it makes sense. I've only skimmed my way through. It's worthy of a more
detailed reading, though I'll try to see if there are better
translations/version available (in particular with regards to notation and
typography)

- 2019-05-17 Lucian Boia: Între înger şi fiară - Mitul omului diferit din Antichitate până în zilele noastre
: A history of the myths of 'them' vs. 'us'. Not the best of his books, mainly
due to the fact that it's a history of nonsensical ideas. An example to
remember is how during Enlightenment, thinking still dominated by religious
ideas, meant that the other planets of the Solar System had to have a reason to
exist, therefore they were inhabited; some thinkers were therefore trying to
use reason to figure out `what kind` of people were living on the other planets,
not questioning `if`.

- 2019-05-11 Torkel Franzén: Gödel's Theorem - An Incomplete Guide To Its Use And Abuse
: An accessible exploration of what can and what cannot be implied from
Gödel's theorems. Good. Difficulty rating: 12 pages per evening

- 2019-04-27 Euclid: The Thirteen Books of the Elements / Translated and commentary by Sir Thomas L. Heath / Vol.1 (Books I and II)
: Beautiful insights into logic and reasoning from a book written more than
2300 years ago. Very very good. Difficulty rating: 3 pages per evening.

- 2019-02-08: articles on unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics
: See [reading notes][effectiveness]. Hamming's one is particularly
interesting.

- 2019-02-06: N. Wirth: Programming Development by Stepwise Refinement / Communications of the ACM, Vol. 14, No. 4, p221-227, April 1971.
: Not a book, an article. Describes the eight queens problem. OK-ish.

- 2019-01-21: Edsger W. Dijkstra: The Humble Programmer / ACM Turing Lecture 1972
: Not a book, an article. Gem about the nature of developing software. See
[reading-notes][humble]. Good.

- 2019-01-18 - Hans Rosling: Factfulness
: In style of Stephen Pinker's [Enlightenement
Now][s-pinker-enlightenment-now], it's data supporting a view of the world such
that the world is improving and it is possible to improve further. It describes
a yardstick measure of life at four income levels. It describes the gap
instinct of expecting to identify clear boundaries between categories where in
reality things are murky and conflated. Also why war zone immigrants arrive in
inflatable boats: because regulation prevents them to fly, which costs less,
and the better boats get confiscated at arrival. Difficulty rating: 30 pages
per evening.

- 2019-01-18 Donald E. Knuth: Structured Programming with go to Statements / Computing Surveys, Vol. 6, No. 4, December 1974
: Not a book, a long-ish article, but full of gems including "Premature
optimisation is the root of all evil" and "people have a natural tendency to
set up all easily understood quantitative goal [...] instead of working
directly for a qualitative goal". See [reading notes][premature-optimisation].
Difficulty rating: 6 pages per evening.

NOTE: Some books are rated for difficulty. That's an estimation of pages I can
read in a work day evening (after putting children to bed, dinner, catch-up
with The Important One, etc.). An easy read equates to more pages per evening,
a difficult read equates to less pages.
