List of books I've read in 2019


- 2019-01-18 Donald E. Knuth: Structured Programming with go to Statements
: Not a book, an article, but full of gems including "Premature optimisation is
the root of all evil" and "people have a natural tendency to set up all easily
understood quantitative goal [...] instead of working directly for a
qualitative goal". See [reading notes][premature-optimisation].
