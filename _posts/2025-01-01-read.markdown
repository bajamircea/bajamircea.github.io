List of books I've read in 2025


- Paul Freedman: The Early Middle Ages, 284â€“1000
: Not a book, but video lectures from Open Yale Courses on the fall of the
Roman Empire, the raise of Christianism and Islam and the "Dark Ages" (that
were not that dark, but different). It looks like that's not his specialist
area, but he's a really good historian and teacher. It turns out that heresies
are what the winners call religious controversies, mysticism and thuggery go
hand in hand and Merovingians make good can names.

- 2025-04-20: Arthur Schopenhauer: The Art of Always Being Right
: When I previously encountered examples of informal fallacies, I found them
difficult to internalize. This ironic (pamflet/short book) by Arthur
Schopenhauer is written in a style that I found much easier to remember and
apply: the subversive one.

- 2025-02-01: Alfred Tarski: The Semantic Conception of Truth (Mar 1944)
: Disappointed because I had unrealistic expectations. Tarski focuses on a
meaning of truth that is designed for the meta-mathematics and assumes that
that's it. Did he read Hume?
