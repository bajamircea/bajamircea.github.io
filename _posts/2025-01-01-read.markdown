List of books I've read in 2024


- 2025-09-17: John Woolman: The Journal of John Woolman
: John Woolman was a Quaker, living around the time of Benjamin Franklin, known
for his work against slavery. Him being deeply religious the book is full of
formulaic phrases in the style "With tenderness of heart, I humbly sought to
the Lord for instructions and God settled my mind to go and see our friends in
Carolina; so I went with met with our friends in Carolina" instead of "I
fancied to see our friends in Carolina, so off I went". This is a different
style from Benjamin Franklin who also read Plutarch and Plato, not just the
Bible and the Psalms. But underneath that it's very interesting to see a man
who realised the moral wrongs of slavery against the status quo and the customs
of his peers. How when he was confronted the first time to write, as a clerk,
an act of sale of a black slave he hesitated and complained, but the following
times he refused, politely, to do it. How he finds a niche on will writing,
realising that people are more willing to part with slaves at death even if
they are more reluctant to deal with the economic uncertainties during their
lifetimes. How he tries to convince people, including meeting them on the
religious turf e.g. handling pseudo-justifications that blacks are descendants
of Cain, thus unfavoured by god, with the reminder that we are all descendants
of Noah, the ones of Cain having died during The Flood. At a wider picture he
raises the question of what do we want in life, that material goals are not
everything. In a way he does a lot of things right, but for the wrong
(religious) reasons. He would do the wrong thing if he felt religion would
justify it. When going on a boat trip Benjamin Franklin thought "we should
build more lighthouses, they save lives", John Woolman would mainly see to
influence religiously the sailors. He died of smallpox as was against
inoculation (unlike Benjamin Franklin), perceiving smallpox an act of God that
we should not meddle with.

- 2025-09-05: Benjamin Franklin: Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin
: Really lovely book to read, every dozen of pages of so there is a absolutely
memorable story. 10 out of 10

In the context of becoming a vegetarian, then being tempted to eat cod fish, he
considered sticking to his principles, but seeing little fishes inside the cod
fishes he changed his mind:
> . So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables
> one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.

In the context of his son dying of smallpox, which he should have vaccinated
(he was aware of vaccination, inoculation in those times, and also of the risks
of the inoculation):
> In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the
> small-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still
> regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the
> sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should
> never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that
> the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should
> be chosen.

In the context of (being against patents):
> That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should
> be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this
> we should do freely and generously.

On the answer given by James Logan to William Penn, when scolded for staying to
handle a gun on the deck of the ship against a potential attack (it turned out
not be an enemy ship, but a friendly one), against the Quaker oaths, instead of
retiring into the cabin:
> "I being thy servant, why did thee not order me to come down? But thee was
> willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship when thee
> thought there was danger."

On what kind of things make us happy:
> Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that
> seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day. [Giving someone small
> bits of daily joys], you may contribute more to the happiness of his life
> than in giving him a thousand guineas. The money may be soon spent, the
> regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it;

On the inability of rules to take sound decisions:
> But such mistakes are not new; history is full of the errors of states and
> princes.

Similarities on the situation of England not wanting Colonies to be armed, in
order to control them, but loosing that control because it did not then provide
defence when the Colonies were in danger, to what happens not with US not
providing Europe with the military and moral support it needs in this times
where the European security is threatened.

On being surprised that a protestant group believed to not bear arms, did so
when under danger of being killed by Indians:
> but common sense, aided by present danger, will sometimes be too strong for
> whimsical opinions.

On the observation of human behaviour when active vs. inactive:
> This gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, they are best
> content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'd and cheerful,
> and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work, they spent the
> evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome,
> finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in continual ill-humour.

He mentions he met with David Hume (I seem to have a like for 18th century). He
also mentions Richardson's Pamela (the one that triggered Henry Fielding's
Shamela). I suspect he was part of a group that were really well educated (e.g.
he mentions that he can't remember a time when he could not read, he figured
out early that Plutarch's Lives is more interesting than his dad's religious
controversies etc.). E.g. his public negotiation approaches remind me of the
advice Plutarch's dad to use "we" rather than "I" and give credit to his
partner.

It's interesting to see his business skills and knowledge in contract writing.
There are parallels between the issues of the time when large parts of
Pennsylvania were owned by proprietors unwilling to pay tax (e.g. for defending
it) and current questions of tax fairness on both sides of the Atlantic. There
are parallels on the issue of making money via lucrative governmental contracts
then and now.

I did not investigate though his racial prejudices (would not be surprised to
be disappointed).

- 2025-08-24: Benjamin Graham, Charles McGolrick: The Interpretation of Financial Statements 1955
: Reread

- 2025-08-21: Felix Klein: Elementary Mathematics From an Advanced Standpoint 1945 English translation of 1924 work
: Difficult for me, eventually skipped parts that were too hard, but many
interesting ideas under the complexity of the text. Interesting to see how
maths can be approached as a historical discovery process or as a isolated, yet
polished theory. Although I skipped most of the quaternions, the beginning was
quite interesting on e.g. the choices to be made, giving up on multiplication
commutativity. The idea of having geometrical representations as a mean of
learning and understanding, for functions and equations with complex arguments.
Gauss might be worth a read. The problems with log being defined as inverse of
exponentiation and how using complex functions eventually provides insights. I
should read more about convergence of Taylor series.

- 2025-08-17: Henry Fielding:Shamela
: Very funny.

- 2025-08-15: ntoine de Saint-Exupéry: Le Petit Prince
: Ambiguous in meaning to the point of boring. As a grown up I had the
endurance to keep going. As a child I have up due to the randomness of
nonsense. The best of the book is the dedication. Read in French. Good for
refreshing my French.

- 2025-08-13: Jonathan P. Berkley: The Formation of Islam - Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800
: Interesting. An example is that literature about a period reflects the issues
of the period when it was written, not necessarily of the period that it
describes

- 2025-08-09: Harper Lee: To Kill A Mockingbird
: Euch. Did not enjoy it. I had to keep on remembering that it's fiction,
despite it trying to depict race mentalities of a period. The child character
Scout has way to many insights for a child. Also Atticus is portrayed as part
of a heroic group, but there is the double standard where the black Tom
Robinson is brought to trial, but the white Boo is not.

- Paul Freedman: The Early Middle Ages, 284–1000
: Not a book, but video lectures from Open Yale Courses on the fall of the
Roman Empire, the raise of Christianism and Islam and the "Dark Ages" (that
were not that dark, but different). It looks like that's not his specialist
area, but he's a really good historian and teacher. It turns out that heresies
are what the winners call religious controversies, mysticism and thuggery go
hand in hand and Merovingians make good can names.

- 2025-04-20: Arthur Schopenhauer: The Art of Always Being Right
: When I previously encountered examples of informal fallacies, I found them
difficult to internalize. This ironic (pamflet/short book) by Arthur
Schopenhauer is written in a style that I found much easier to remember and
apply: the subversive one.

- 2025-02-01: Alfred Tarski: The Semantic Conception of Truth (Mar 1944)
: Disappointed because I had unrealistic expectations. Tarski focuses on a
meaning of truth that is designed for the meta-mathematics and assumes that
that's it. Did he read Hume?
