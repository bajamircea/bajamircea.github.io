List of books I've read in 2025


- 2025-08-24: Benjamin Graham, Charles McGolrick: The Interpretation of Financial Statements 1955
: Reread

- 2025-08-21: Felix Klein: Elementary Mathematics From an Advanced Standpoint 1945 English translation of 1924 work
: Difficult for me, eventually skipped parts that were too hard, but many
interesting ideas under the complexity of the text. Interesting to see how
maths can be approached as a historical discovery process or as a isolated, yet
polished theory. Although I skipped most of the quaternions, the beginning was
quite interesting on e.g. the choices to be made, giving up on multiplication
commutativity. The idea of having geometrical representations as a mean of
learning and understanding, for functions and equations with complex arguments.
Gauss might be worth a read. The problems with log being defined as inverse of
exponentiation and how using complex functions eventually provides insights. I
should read more about convergence of Taylor series.

- 2025-08-17: Henry Fielding:Shamela
: Very funny.

- 2025-08-15: ntoine de Saint-Exupéry: Le Petit Prince
: Ambiguous in meaning to the point of boring. As a grown up I had the
endurance to keep going. As a child I have up due to the randomness of
nonsense. The best of the book is the dedication. Read in French. Good for
refreshing my French.

- 2025-08-13: Jonathan P. Berkley: The Formation of Islam - Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800
: Interesting. An example is that literature about a period reflects the issues
of the period when it was written, not necessarily of the period that it
describes

- 2025-08-09: Harper Lee: To Kill A Mockingbird
: Euch. Did not enjoy it. I had to keep on remembering that it's fiction,
despite it trying to depict race mentalities of a period. The child character
Scout has way to many insights for a child. Also Atticus is portrayed as part
of a heroic group, but there is the double standard where the black Tom
Robinson is brought to trial, but the white Boo is not.

- Paul Freedman: The Early Middle Ages, 284–1000
: Not a book, but video lectures from Open Yale Courses on the fall of the
Roman Empire, the raise of Christianism and Islam and the "Dark Ages" (that
were not that dark, but different). It looks like that's not his specialist
area, but he's a really good historian and teacher. It turns out that heresies
are what the winners call religious controversies, mysticism and thuggery go
hand in hand and Merovingians make good can names.

- 2025-04-20: Arthur Schopenhauer: The Art of Always Being Right
: When I previously encountered examples of informal fallacies, I found them
difficult to internalize. This ironic (pamflet/short book) by Arthur
Schopenhauer is written in a style that I found much easier to remember and
apply: the subversive one.

- 2025-02-01: Alfred Tarski: The Semantic Conception of Truth (Mar 1944)
: Disappointed because I had unrealistic expectations. Tarski focuses on a
meaning of truth that is designed for the meta-mathematics and assumes that
that's it. Did he read Hume?
