List of books I've read in 2025


- 2025-04-20: Arthur Schopenhauer: The Art of Always Being Right
: When I previously encountered examples of informal fallacies, I found them
difficult to internalize. This ironic (pamflet/short book) by Arthur
Schopenhauer is written in a style that I found much easier to remember and
apply: the subversive one.

- 2025-02-01: Alfred Tarski: The Semantic Conception of Truth (Mar 1944)
: Disappointed because I had unrealistic expectations. Tarski focuses on a
meaning of truth that is designed for the meta-mathematics and assumes that
that's it. Did he read Hume?
