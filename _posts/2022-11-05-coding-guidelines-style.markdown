Coding guidelines are the Strunk & White for programming languages: famous,
influential, in demand, but mediocre. A look at the C.12 rule on const usage
from the C++ Core Guidelines.


This article is part of a series of [articles on programming
idioms][idioms-intro].

# The C.12 rule

Consider the [C.12 rule in the C++ Core Guidelines][c12]. Its contents says:

**_C.12: Don’t make data members const or references_**

**_Reason_**

_They are not useful, and make types difficult to use by making them either
uncopyable or partially uncopyable for subtle reasons._

**Example; bad**
{% highlight c++ %}
class bad {
    const int i;    // bad
    string& s;      // bad
    // ...
};
{% endhighlight %}

_The `const` and `&` data members make this class "only-sort-of-copyable" –
copy-constructible but not copy-assignable._

**_Note_**

_If you need a member to point to something, use a pointer (raw or smart, and
`gsl::not_null` if it should not be `null`) instead of a reference._

**_Enforcement_**

_Flag a data member that is `const`, `&`, or `&&`._


# Critique of the rule

One issue with coding guidelines is that they are not necessarily explicit
about the idioms they refer to.

To the regular data idiom this rule applies.

But we've seen in glorious details that in the mockable interfaces idiom we
have a good reason to use references for the member interfaces or `const` for
the member string. We've also seen the `lower_bound_predicate` using both const
and reference.

In this particular case a combination of the fact that it refers to member
variables as data members and the fact that it is in a section that mentions
concrete/regular classes suggests that the rule is supposed to apply to regular
data classes from the regular idiom.

**Literal interpretation of coding guidelines without applying thorough
reasoning is a dangerous thing. Regard with suspicion the developer that quotes
the coding rule number instead of providing a compelling justification.**


# Notable public C++ coding standards

Bjarne Stoustrup produced a [C++ coding standard for the Joint Strike
Fighter](https://www.stroustrup.com/JSF-AV-rules.pdf), basically for embedded
systems on an airplane. C++ exceptions were not allowed due to the lack of
guarantees required for such a system. Many users thought "but my system is
different" so the standard was ignored by large parts of the C++ community.

[Google then published their C++ Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). They did not use
exceptions either. In this case due to being cautious of introducing them in a
large, legacy code that did not use C++ exceptions.

Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter merge code guidelines from the organisations
where they worked, Morgan Stanley and Microsoft, and others into the [C++ Core
Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuideline) from
where the rule above is taken.


# Parallels to Strunk & White

Strunk & White is a language style guide that is often familiar to US
college/university students and it's supposed to contain adive on good writing
style for such students. Surprisingly it's almost unknown in Britain.

Like many programming coding guidelies it's popular and written in a similar
simplistic style of rules like "always to this" or "never do this", for example
use the active voice not the passive voice.

The advice does not address the questions "then why passive voice exists, where
is it useful?" and they hilariosly contradict themselves by using the passive
voice to provide the advice:

> Many a tame sentence ... can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a
> transitive in the active voice

And that creates a wrong frame of mind. There are better books on language
style out there that for have more complex, but more effective rules e.g.
identify what is known, old information, vs. what is newly introduced to the
reader and the passive voice can be used to make that transition smoothly
rather than jumping back between new and old.


# Conclusion

Having C++ coding standards is better than not having any. They are often not
explicit about the idioms they support or the fact that multiple idioms might
coexist in a large code base. They are often phrased as over simplified rules
and often lack context.

Thy are not state of the art, it's not where ideas and sound judgement come
from.
