Lessons learned while calculating the 1 millionth entry in the Fibonacci
sequence


# Introduction

Obviously naive implementations of [Fibonacci][fib] are slow. Everyone and his
dog should be able to implement it recursively, but that has exponential
complexity and quickly takes seconds for mid double digit arguments.

With a bit of care, all programmers should be able to implement linear
complexity versions.

I [presented this](/presentations/2020-02-26-irregularity.html) at ACCU in
Oxford.
