All the coal was created in Carboniferous. Why?

Carboniferous is a geologic period that started approx 360 million years ago,
and lasted for about 60 million years ago. All the coal that we extract and
burn (for energy) today, was created in that period and none is created
(practically) today.

The reason is that the beginning of the period is marked by the appearance of
the wood tissue and bark in plants, e.g. in particular the wood fiber lignin.
To start with, the bacteria and fungi was not adapted to decompose this new
substance, so tree trunks accumulated without decomposing, leading to the coal
deposits we use now. Once bacteria evolved and was able the decompose tree
trunks, the creation of coal stopped. And that's why today coal is no longer
created.
