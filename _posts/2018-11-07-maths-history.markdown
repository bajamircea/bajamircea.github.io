Very short mathematics history

**TODO: this is work in progress**

# Babylonians

Babylonians used natural numbers and fractions, albeit usually in a base 60
numeral system. It is possible to count to 12 on one hand, using the thumb to
point to one of the three finger bones in the remaining 4 fingers, and to 60
using two hands.

The advantage of base 60 and of 12 is that they have many factors, making
common fractions (e.g. half, third, quarter), therefore division, easy. That's
important because division is an order of complexity compared with
multiplication, which itself is an order more complex than addition and
subtraction.

Remnants of not using base 10 to this date are the fact we still use 60 seconds
to the minute, 60 minutes to the hour, eggs are sold to the dozen etc.


# Pythagoras or the Greek breakthrough

Mathematics flourished in the ancient Greek culture, and one milestone in this
development was Pythagoras (around 500 BC).

From Babylonians, Pythagoras took tables of triples of integers such as as
$$(3, 4, 5)$$, $$(5, 12, 13)$$, that can form right angled triangles.

But he took it further, from a catalogue of numbers that happen to have a
relation, to the general theorem stating that:

> In any right-angled triangle the square of the side opposite the right angle
> equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides

So far so good: look at this beauty that links geometry to natural numbers.

However it soon become evident that natural numbers are not enough, because of
he realised that the diagonal of a square, does not have a common unit with the
side of the square. In modern language we would say that they discovered that
$$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational, i.e. that it has an infinite number of decimals.

The links between geometry, numbers and infinity, is a theme that runs deep
throughout the mathematics history.
