Very short mathematics history

**TODO: this is work in progress**

# Babylonians

Babylonians used natural numbers and fractions, albeit usually in a base 60
numeral system. It is possible to count to 12 on one hand, using the thumb to
point to one of the three finger bones in the remaining 4 fingers, and to 60
using two hands.

The advantage of base 60 and of 12 is that they have many factors, making
common fractions (e.g. half, third, quarter), therefore division, easy. That's
important because division is an order of complexity compared with
multiplication, which itself is an order more complex than addition and
subtraction.

Remnants of not using base 10 to this date are the fact we still use 60 seconds
to the minute, 60 minutes to the hour, eggs are sold to the dozen etc.


# Pythagoras or the Greek breakthrough

Triplets such as $$(3, 4, 5)$$, $$(5, 12, 13)$$, $$(6, 8, 10)$$, $$(7, 24,
25)$$ [have been known][plimpton] since about 2000 BC by the Egyptians and
Babylonians, first on the basis of 'here are some values that have a certain
property', later as a rule, introduced to the Greeks by Pythagoras (around 500
BC) as:

> In a right-angled triangle the square of the side opposite the right angle
> equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides

It is believed that one of the initial proves of the rule involved sliding
around same sized right angled triangles inside a square:

For a while it looked like there is a beautiful link between numbers and
geometry.

By numbers they meant strictly positive integers and rational numbers (i.e.
ratios). However it soon become evident that they are not enough to reflect
sizes in geometry. The diagonal of a square, does not have a common unit with
the side of the square. In modern language we would say that they discovered
that $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational, i.e. that it has an infinite number of
decimals.

The links between geometry, numbers and infinity, is a theme that runs deep
throughout the mathematics history.


# Euclid

Mathematics flourished in the ancient Greek culture, and in Euclid's Elements
it reached it's peak.
