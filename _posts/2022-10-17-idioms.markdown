What are programming idioms?

A mature programming language has many features. I'm going to use C++ as an
example, but the ideas apply elsewhere as well. For example there will features
to customize data copying, destructors, make members public or private,
different of passing arguments to a function etc.

**A programming idiom is a group of rules and choices that uses language
features in a coherent, well understood way, in order to solve a specific kind
of problems.**

A mature programming language would support multiple idioms. Sample idioms that
I'm going to cover here are:
- Regular data and functions
- C API wrapper
- Mockable interfaces

Idiomatic code follows the rules of one such idiom. Hopefully programmers than
recognise the pattern and they can focus on the problem at hand without having
to repeatedly justify the choices.

When a choice diverges from the idiomatic way, there could be several reasons
that range from:
- There could be a good reason to do so. That might require some comment to
  explain the reason.
- It's an incorrect choice. Despite that, it might be difficult to change due
  to a number of factors including existing legacy code.

However most of the divergence lives in the space in between, where suboptimal
choices are made, the divergence is only partial, there is more to gain from
adopting the idiom than from choosing the divergence, but the pain point is not
enough for developers to adopt better habits.

Code convention/guidelines documents traditionally both helped and hurt the
adoption of good rules. Their main problem is that they do not address
explicitly multiple idioms handling language feature usage in the form "always
do this, except here and here and here" or "don't do this, except here and
here".

As we'll see for the three idioms above: copy, move, equality and const are
handled differently.
