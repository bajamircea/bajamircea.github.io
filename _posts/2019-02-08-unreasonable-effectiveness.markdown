Reading notes on two papers on the subject of the unreasonable effectiveness of
mathematics


# Eugene Wigner
## The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences
- the idea of invariance in science, e.g. in Galileo's Tower of Pisa
  experiments the objects fell at the same speed, regardless if they
  were let go by one person, or by two people, or wether one person
  was a man and the other a woman.
- that often laws have been found to apply outside the situations
  where the idea originated, and with higher precision than the
  precision of the initial data

# Richard W. Hamming
## The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics
- "Most textbooks repeat the Greeks and say that geometry arose from
  the needs of the Egyptians to survey the land after each flooding by
  the Nile River, but I attribute much more to aesthetics than do most
  historians of mathematics and correspondingly less to immediately
  utility." [p84]
  - Certainly the organisation of geometry as done by Euclid is not
    motivated by immediate utility. See for example Elements, Book I,
    Proposition 10, where Euclid's proof aims to minimise repetition and
    shorten the proof. Compare this with the approach by Apollonius
    which is more practical from the number of steps of the
    construction, but would repeat the proof of Book I Proposition 1.
- "Is it not remarkable that 6 sheep plus 7 sheep make 13 sheep; that 6
  stones plus 7 stones make 13 stones? Is it not a miracle that the
  universe is so constructed that such a simple abstraction as a
  number is possible? To me this is one of the strongest examples of
  the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. Indeed, I find it
  both strange and unexplainable." [p84]
  - I think that the acceptance of 1 and 0 is a cultural issue so
    entrenched that it makes it hard for us to reason outside this
    box, but ultimately it's an arbitrary choice.
- with regards to Euclid's Elements: "Yet how does it happen that no
  theorem in all the thirteen books is now false? Not one theorem has
  been found to be false, though often the proofs given by Euclid seem
  now to be false." [p86]
- "It is not that the postulation approach is wrong, only that its
  arbitrariness should be clearly recognized, and we should be prepared
  to change postulates when the need becomes apparent" [p86]
- "We see what we look for." [p87]
  - same as "To a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail"
- ""Why should I do all the analysis in terms of Fourier integrals?
  Why are they the natural tools for the problem?" I soon found out,
  as many of you already know, that the eigenfunctions of translation
  are the complex exponentials. If you want time invariance, and
  certainly physicists and engineers do (so that an experiment done
  today or tomorrow will give the same results), then you are led to
  these functions." [p88]
  - Well, I didn't know. Something to look into.
- "And many people believe that the two relativity theories rest more
  on philosophical grounds than on actual experiments." [p88]
  - I concur.
- "Science in fact answers comparatively few problems" [p89]
  - An example: the simple pendulum law that the period of oscillation
    depends on the pendulum length, but not on the mass and initial
    angle. Yes, it covers a lot of cases, but there are much more
    cases that are not covered.
- "We find, for example, that we can cope with thinking about the
  world when it is of comparable size to ourselves and our raw unaided
  senses, but that when we go to the very small or the very large then
  our thinking has great trouble" [p89]
  - e.g. the Euclidian geometry is particularly successful at human
    scale, but starts to fail at atomic or cosmic scales.
- It's surprising to see what a small world it is. Reference section includes
  Euclid's Elements, in particular the Thomas L. Heath translation that I'm
  currently reading, recommended by Alex Stepanov.
