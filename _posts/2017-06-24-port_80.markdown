Unexpected leftover from C hits back.


# Code sample

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::string x;
  x += ":" + 80;
  std::cout << x << "\n";
}
{% endhighlight %}


It should not compile (or at least it should give a warning). Yet it does; on
my system it prints 'i'. I rest my case.

Once you figure out what happens: I wonder if fundamentally this is caused by
literals not being separate types, e.g. `":"` is a `const char *`, `80` is an
`int`, rather than separate types.
