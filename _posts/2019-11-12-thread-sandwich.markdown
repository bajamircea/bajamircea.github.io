A common code structure pattern for multi-threading is the sandwich pattern


# Introduction

When writing multi-threading code using low level primitives, a difficult issue
that developers face is how to structure code to avoid a large monolithic chunk
of code and break it instead into smaller units:
- That can be thoroughly reasoned about the correctness
- That have a clear purpose and separate threading concerns from application
  functionality
- That breaks circular references when several communicating threads are
  involved
- That can be unit tested

The sandwich pattern is a way of structuring multi-threading code which breaks
the threading concerns into several entities. The core application **function**
is sandwiched between a thread **control** layer that manages pending workload
and the **threading** layer that manages the actual thread lifetime.

The example below mimics two jugglers throwing balls to each other. The balls
are just `int`s with values 1, 2 and 3.

The dependencies between the involved objects looks like this:

The application **function** is in this case "when you handle a ball, throw it
to the other juggler". In the code below it depends on the control layer for
the other juggler (where the ball will be thrown) and it's implemented as
lambdas inside the `main` function body (due to it's simplicity).

The **control** layer manages the balls to be handled by the juggler. In the
code below it's implemented by the `thread_control` template class that holds a
queue of some data type, a flag used for stopping the thread, and a `mutex` and
`condition_variable` for synchronization. This class is instantiated in the
`main` function body for `int` as the data type. It also has methods to
manipulate that data:
- `post_data`: to throw a ball. This would be called from a different thread.
- `serve`: to serve the balls. This would be called from the underlying thread
  and would receive the application function.
- `stop_serving` to set the stop flag. This would be called from some thread
  that manages the life of the jugglers thread, the main thread in this case.
- `raw_data`: to access the data with no synchronization. This could be useful
  for scenarios where the user knows that synchronization is not required.

The  **thread** layer handles starting and stopping the thread and runs the
processing loop. In the code below it's implemented by the `stoppable_thread`
template class. The constructor and destructor of `stoppable_thread` manage the
lifetime of the native thread.

# Additional notes

The code above is an example. I'm going to describe a few details that would
hopefully disambiguate what aspects are important, and which are merely
accidental.


## Similarities to asio io_context

The `thread_control` is similar to the `asio::io_context` object. `io_contex`
has similar methods to post work to a queue, to process work from the queue and
to stop processing. In that case the queue of work is implemented using IO
completion ports on Windows for example.

Alternatively one could have the `thread_control` as a structure with public
member variables and make the member functions as standalone functions. In that
case `raw_data()` would no longer be required.


## Instantiation

What creates the sandwich pattern is that dependencies are provided in
constructors. This way:
- The control needs to be instantiated first
- Then the function (in this case a lambda) takes in the constructor a
  reference of a control instance (in this case the control of another thread)
- The underlying thread (`stopable_thread` in this case) takes in the
  constructor a reference to the control instance and makes a copy of the
  function

We achieve customization using dependencies injected at construction without
using inheritance. Inheritance is sometimes [a trap][thread-bug].


## Object lifetime

The object lifetime is significant in several places above. It's controlled in
the example above explicitly by having additional pairs of curly brackets or
implicitly by function scope.

In `main` we use a pair of curly brackets to control the scope of the running
threads. Outside that scope the threads are not running, so we can access using
`raw_data` without any synchronization. We can reason about the correctness of
this using [synchronizes-with][synchronizes-with] terminology for `std::thread`
construction and `join`. These curly brackets are there just to make a
interesting example, we rarely need create an explicit scope for
`stoppable_thread`, different from the one for `thread_control`.

Inside the `serve` function we control the lifetime of the `unique_lock`
variable so that the `mutex` is unlocked for the duration of the processing
function. This allows another thread to post additional data in the meantime.

In `stop_serving` and `post_data` we control the lifetime of the `scoped_lock`
variable so that the `mutex` is unlocked before we call `notify_one` on the
`condition_variable`.

Calling `notify_one` on the `condition_variable` before the `mutex` is unlocked
would not be ideal because the thread that is notified can't wake up and
proceed from waiting on the `condition_variable`: it will have to go back to
sleep until the `mutex` is `unlocked`. But in practice it will work, and I
would expect that the threading libraries will deal with the not-ideal scenario
without too much performance loss.

However notice that before `join`-ing the thread we really need to ensure that
the `mutex` is unlocked, else the thread can't lock it to check the stop flag.
We can't put the code from `stop_serving` directly into the destructor of the
`stopable_thread` and get rid of the explicit scope the `lock`.


# Shutting-down

At some point the worker threads need to stop. In a real application this would
be when the user closes an application or when a daemon/service needs to stop.
In this dummy example we used a short sleep delay on the main thread.

We use the `stopable_thread` class because some quirks on the behaviour of
`std::thread`. It [terminates if not joined][std-thread] (i.e. if the native
thread is still running by the time the `std::thread` destructor is called). If
that were not the case, the native thread might still continue to access data
that would go out of scope (such as the `thread_control` in our example)
corrupting and crashing in ways that are difficult to diagnose.


# Exceptions

Exception handling is a particular case where some aspects in the code above
are important, whereas in other cases there is simplification for the sake of
the example.

By properly using RAII in `stoppable_thread`, if we created the first thread in
`main`, but there are errors creating the second one which throw an exeption,
the destructor of the first thread will take care of stopping it. This assumes
that you'll add a `catch` block around the `main` body, which I've omitted for
brevity. This is normal RAII related exception handling.

It turns out that locking a `mutex` can throw. That can happen "when errors
occur, including errors from the underlying operating system that would prevent
lock from meeting its specifications".

The code above locks a `mutex` in `stop_serving`. That is called from the
`stoppable_thread` destructor. Destructors are implicitly `noexcept`. Throwing
from a `noexcept` function terminates the process. So if locking the `mutex`
throws, the process will be terminated. This is unintuitive, but important in
the code above. The rationale is similar to the [std::thread termination case
if not joined][std-thread]: if we started threads, but can't communicate to
stop them, there is no recovery from this situation.

The same is the case for `unique_lock` inside `serve`. If the `mutex` throws in
`lock` it is not handled by the application code and will terminate the
process. The rationale is that if we can't lock the `mutex`, we can't
communicate to stop the thread, we might as well terminate, there is no
recovery.


# Data loss and flow control

**An application has to have a strategy to either deal with data loss or ensure
that it does not happen**.

This is the issue of what to do when processing the item taken from the queue
fails with an exception (i.e. from within the `fn()` call inside `serve()`).

Some options are:

- Terminate. This is what the example does, for brevity reasons. As it is,
  should `fn()` exit with an exception, it is not handled by the application
  code and will terminate the process. This is appropriate for non-critical
  applications where the error is very unlikely. In the example above it would
  be an exception from `post_data()` e.g. out of memory when adding to the
  `deque` or exception from the `lock()` of the `mutex`.
- Retry. One problem with this approach is that it's usually uncertain that
  retrying will not encounter the same error again, leading to the risk of an
  infinite retry loop, so at least the retry is sometimes done on a timer to
  only retry periodically, rather than in a tight loop.
- Ignore and continue. This leads to data loss. Depending on how far the
  processing goes, it might mean that data was taken out of the queue, but if
  something else waits for a response, the response will not arrive.
- Ensure data loss won't happen. This is sometimes possible, either because the
  processing is guaranteed to not have exceptions or, in the case where a
  response is expected, ensure that enough is allocated by the sender so that
  at least an error can be propagated back.

**An application also has to have a strategy for flow control**. This is often
related to the data loss strategy. This is the issue of how to deal with
pending work accumulating faster than it is processed. This falls from the fact
that in systems that involve two communicating parties, it is bound that one
will be slower than the other.

Some options when too much pending work accumulates are:

- Terminate. Terminating the process might be appropriate for non-critical
  applications. Also it might work in scenarios where the termination is
  partial e.g. a connection is closed and a new connection is started. In
  either case this might lead to data loss for the existing pending work.
- Only keep last value. This is appropriate for cases where state information
  is sent, and only the last state matters. E.g. when tracking the number of
  people in a room, if the number of people change faster than it can be
  processed, it might be fine to only update to the last value of people in a
  room, loosing data about intermediate states.
- Ensure it does not happen. Sometimes there is a natural limit to the amount
  of pending work. In our simple jugglers example there will be at most 3 items
  in the queue.

**An application also has to deal with data left in the queue when threads
stop**. At least the data has to be freed and not cause resource/memory leaks.

Some options are:

- Discard (this is the simplest one).
- Process, at least in a limited way. E.g. if the data refers to a network
  connection, one could stop accepting further connections, send an error
  message and close the existing connection, then resume the shutdown sequence.

Note that if you run the sample application several times, it will tend to
print balls left in the second juggler queue. The reason is that the second
juggler thread is destroyed, hence stopped, first. While the second juggler
thread is stopping, the first juggler thread is busy posting data to the second
juggler's queue.


# On testing

The separation in different entities makes it easier to test. The **function**
layer can be tested using single threaded applications, whereas for the
`thread_control` and `stoppable_thread` tests can also be written, such as the
example below that tests that if two items are posted, they are processed in
order.

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
TEST(can_process_two_items)
{
  int processed_count = 0;
  thread_control<bool> main_tc;

  {
    thread_control<int> tc;
    auto fn =[&main_tc, &processed_count](int x) {
      ASSERT_EQ(processed_count, x);
      ++processed_count;
      if (2 == processed_count) {
        main_tc.stop_serving();
      }
    };
    stoppable_thread<int> st(tc, fn);
    tc.post_data(0);
    tc.post_data(1);

    main_tc.serve([](bool){});
  }

  ASSERT_EQ(2, processed_count);
}
{% endhighlight %}


# Templates

I've used template classes for `thread_control` and `stoppable_thread`. That
was just to help imagine that they can be used to hold arbitrary data, not just
`int`s.

On the other side `thread_control::serve` and the constructor of
`stoppable_thread` are template functions so that they can efficiently receive
any function (lambdas in our example) without additional memory allocations
that `std::function` will required.  That is a useful technique. But for long
running threads the cost that will probably matter would be the efficiency of
operations inside the thread loop in `serve`.


# Structuring applications

A common anti-pattern is structuring applications so that all the functionality
about `Xyz` is dealt by a large monolithic class `XyzManager` that does all
things `Xyz` related, including running it's own threads. Then the application
is composed out of such classes. This is a [anthropomorphic view of the
world][anthropomorphic] which results in circular references between these
classes, often badly solved via [start/stop style methods][bad-start].

A better approach is to declare the threads (either single or in thread pools)
upfront and describe the functions to be run on such threads, as it's done in
the code example above. This breaks the circular references by defining
additional entities, such as the `thread_control` class that holds pending
work.


# Conclusion

Writing multi-threaded code is more complex than single-threaded code. The
thread sandwich pattern is not the only way to tackle multi-threaded code, but
the code above and the many issues to consider discussed above set a minimal
standard for writing multi-threaded code.
