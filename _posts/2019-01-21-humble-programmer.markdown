Reading notes on Dijkstra's Turing lecture


# Notes

Dijkstra's Turing lecture is mentioned in Knuth's "Structured Programming with
go to Statements".

There are two gems that relate to the importance of good design that
can lead to lower development costs.

-  "software seems to be different from many other products, where as
   a rule a higher quality implies a higher price. Those who want
   really reliable software will discover that they must find means of
   avoiding the majority of bugs to start with, and as a result the
   programming process will become cheaper." [p8]

- "The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program
  significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness. But
  one should not first make the program and then prove its
  correctness, because then the requirement of providing the proof
  would only increase the poor programmerâ€™s burden. On the contrary:
  the programmer should let correctness proof and program grow hand in
  hand." [p10]
