List of books I've read in 2022

- 2022-01-16 R. Dedekind: The Nature and Meaning of Numbers (1888)
: Paper that explores the set theory around the definition of the natural
numbers. It also explores the definition by induction of the basic operations
of addition, multiplication and exponentiation.

- 2022-01-07 R. Dedekind: Continuity and Irrational Numbers (1872)
: The paper that introduced the Dedekind cut as a definition for real numbers
that avoid the recurse to geometric interpretations

- 2022-01-04 Scott Jurek: Eat & Run
: Runner's book in the spirit of Born to Run. This one is more
auto-biographical, it was an easy pleasant read.
