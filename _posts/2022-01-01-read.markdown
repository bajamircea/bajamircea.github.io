List of books I've read in 2022

- 2022-05-14 Frank Partnoy: Fiasco, the inside story of a Wall Street trader
: Interesting story about usage of derivatives largely to allow asset managers
to place bets that they should not (using other people money of course).

- 2022-05-07 Jared Diamond: Guns, Germs & Steel
: Very interesting and stimulating book, full of ideas. The theme is looking at
underlying advantages that societies gain based on the environment. In
particular the rise of the agriculture, due to the availability of domesticable
plants and animals, a east-west axis making easier to spread food production
compared to north-south axis that slows down adoption due to climate
differences, a larger land mass available. The Austonesian expansion from
Taiwan to the islands from Philippines, Indonesia, Pacific Islands, Madagascar.
The Bantu expansion in Africa. The chapter "From Egalitarianism to Kleptocracy"
was also interesting. Some things not convincing: the story about oak and
acorns not being domesticated does not tally: how about walnuts? Also while
some societies have environment advantages over others, probably even within
the advantaged society some inhabitants will benefit and others will perish. A
bit repetitive. 9.5 out of 10.

- 2022-01-16 R. Dedekind: The Nature and Meaning of Numbers (1888)
: Paper that explores the set theory around the definition of the natural
numbers. It also explores the definition by induction of the basic operations
of addition, multiplication and exponentiation.

- 2022-01-07 R. Dedekind: Continuity and Irrational Numbers (1872)
: The paper that introduced the Dedekind cut as a definition for real numbers
that avoid the recurse to geometric interpretations

- 2022-01-04 Scott Jurek: Eat & Run
: Runner's book in the spirit of Born to Run. This one is more
auto-biographical, it was an easy pleasant read.
