The difference 100 years makes (or does not), though books I've recently read.

# 17th century (1680s)

17th century is when the English Civil War happened. A lot of religious
fervour. Christianity in England was still in the phase of "you have to be the
right kind of Christian, or else you're in trouble". A log of uncertainty:
which is going to be the dominant sect? Is it going to be Catholics, is it
going to be the Anglicans? All sort of variations emerge in this period
Puritans, Quakers etc. To say that some move to America to freely practice
their religion underestimates both the difficulties you're in if you're the
minority sect, but also the fervour of the (many) minority sects.

Towards the end of the century we have William Penn, of Pennsylvania fame.
Rich. Quaker. Religious, but well read. He read classics: "Eat to live, not
live to eat" comes from Socrates. He wears a wig because he lost his hair from
smallpox in his youth, but he survived it.


# 18th century (1750s)

For this period I'm going to cover three people, to see differences as well as
similarities.

John Woolman, not very well known nowadays, was influential in the abolition of
slavery. Quaker. Properly religious. All he read was the Bible, the many notes
of the many Quaker meetings (weekly, monthly, quarterly). And psalms. He was
influential between the Quakers on abolishing slavery. The Quakers though were
influential e.g. in governing Pennsylvania. But he's against slavery for
reasons that have to do with his religious ideas, not directly out of moral
reasons.

Benjamin Franklin. His father emigrated to America with his uncle, reason:
Puritans. The first books that he read were religious controversies that his
dad and uncles cared about. Then he discovers Plutarch. He also quotes "Eat to
live, not live to eat", in fact he practised the Socratic method so well on one
of his bosses that his boss hesitated at the most benign questions asking back
instead "Wait a minute, where is thing going to take me?".

Benjamin Franklin was largely home schooled. He dabbed with going to a school,
but learned a trade instead: he became a printer.

Although Franklin believed in God, there is stark difference rooted into what
he read, compared with Woolman. When Woolman travels to England he tries to
make sailors give up drinking and swearing and become proper Christians. When
Franklin travels to England, he notices that a lighthouse saved them for
crashing into rocks and makes a not to plead for more lighthouses to be build
in America.

John Woolman died of smallpox, Benjamin Franklin's son died of smallpox.

Franklin met with Hume and they talked about their experience of organizing
logistics for military leaders. Hume was an atheist, not openly (it was too
dangerous). On his reading list there was a line of English empiricists that
made the difference.


# 19th century (1940s)

Tom Sawyer, the character of Mark Twain's book. Tom Sawyer was going to the
town school. Children of mixed ages shared the same class and teacher.


# 20th century (1930s)

Two book characters.

Gatsby, the character of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, on the early side of
1930s. Rich, large mansion: he's got a "station wagon". That means the kind of
car that you send your chauffeur to pick your guests and their luggage from the
train station (the equivalent name in England is "estate").

Atticus, the character of Harper Lee, is on the later side of the 1930s. Like
Tom Sawyer, his children go to school, but the school has age-grouped classes.

There's trains. Though for the blacks, there not much difference from Tom
Sawyer's times.


# Now

Well know it looks different: there's computers, Internet, mobile phones. Cars
are more popular than trains. Most people have cars. But other things are
similar. Benjamin Franklin used the printing press that he owned to influence
the public opinion. Musk bought Twitter. Gatsby was rich, but involved in
corruption, there is a resurgence of that, and as in Franklin's time there is
lots of money to be made by getting government's business/military. And sadly,
forms of racism, xenophobia and others on that spectrum of lack of empathy and
humanity, are still present.
