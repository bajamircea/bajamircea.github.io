Introduction to consistency problems in distributed systems

# Consistency - introduction

**Work in progress**

In everyday life **consistency** means "to act in the same way over time".

In logic/mathematics roughly **consistency** means "free of contradictions".
For example a formal system is consistent if it cannot be used to derive both a
statement `S` and it's negation `not S`. But that's the syntactic definition.
It turns out that there are many variations for the definition of the term,
such as 'there is an interpretation under which all it's theorems are true'
(which is the semantic definition).
