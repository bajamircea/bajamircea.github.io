C++ coroutines lab presentations. WORK IN PROGRESS

# Presentations

- [Problem domain](/presentations/2023-08-06-coro-problem-domain.html)
- [Mechanics](/presentations/2023-09-05-coro-mechanics.html)
- Scoped coroutines
  - TODO discuss issue with reference parameters, lambda captures, pointers, string_views 
  - TODO the (invalid) `std::move` trick to call once
  - TODO the co_await by value trick
    - TODO still )potential) scope issue
  - TODO why not eager
    - finall_suspend first
    - the issue with eager initial_suspend when actually suspended later
- Trampoline
- Timers
- Structured concurency
  - sane principles
    - a child coroutine does not outlives its parent
    - a coroutine runs uninterrupted until a co_await
  - TODO: discuss the issue of detach/fire and forget
    - lifetime
    - error propagation
  - TODO: discuss issue with blocking in bounded parallelism cases
  - TODO: discuss issue with destructors blocking
- Cancellation
  - hiding cancellation from function signature (e.g. see `co_await get_cancellation_token()`
- Nursery
- Threading models
- Windows Thread Pool
