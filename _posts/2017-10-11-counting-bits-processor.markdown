Counting the bits set: processor can do best


# Processor can do best

This is where we address the fundamental point, number 1 on the list of issues
with a naive implementaion for counting the bits set. The processor/hardware
can do that best, because it's simpler circuitry compared with other
operations, even compared with just simple addition of two numbers.

AMD/Intel processors have a `POPCNT` instruction since arround 2008.

C/C++ compilers have intrinsics that map to the assembly instruction if
available or otherwise to some optimized algorithm as we've seen in the
previous posts.  The Microsoft compiler has a `__popcnt` intrinsic, Java has a
`bitCount` method with similar behaviour.

Here is the gcc intrinsic:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
int count_bits_6(unsigned int x) {
  return __builtin_popcount(x);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Interestingly some compilers recognise patterns like the [Kernigan
loop][better-loop] and [replace it with POPCNT][mg2017]


# Usage

Counting the bits set is a very niche task, I think. For example it's useful
for some interesting data structures. But I never had to actually do it, except
in an interview scenario where the interviewer was looking for the naive loop.
In that situation my first reaction was "you google for a solution" which made
the interviewer believe I tried to avoid the answer.
