List of books I've read in 2021

- 2021-07-21 Stephen M. R. Covey: The Speed of Trust
: Full of fluff and overly verbose as if written by a "management consultant"
paid by the hour, which probably is his career. In the first 100 pages there
was half of page mildly interesting. Gave up. Lots of metaphoric terms usage in
the style of horoscopes that are true in some sense, but meaningless "Nothing
is as fast as the speed of trust" (the speed of light in void, duh?).  Random
quotes, someone said this and that, without context.  "Research shows" again
without context. Rubbish.

- 2021-07-11 Lucian Boia: Balcic - Micul paradis al României Mari
: Interesting, though overly royalty centred history

- 2021-07-09 Hannah Fry and Thomas Oléron Evans: The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus
: Intended to be light funny maths. Too light. Not recommended. It does mention
Euclid though.

- 2021-05-30 C. Northcote Parkinson: Parkinson's Law (or the pursuit of progress)
: Finally I traced the story about bike-shedding.

- 2021-05-30 C. Northcote Parkinson: In-laws and Outlaws
: It would be funny advice if it would not be so sexist.

- 2021-02-21 Matt Parker: Humble Pi
: Easy math errors read. The interesting part was about non-transitive odds on
coin sequences.

- 2021-02-14 Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos H. Papadimitriou: Logicomix
: Cartoon on Bertrand Russel's contribution to mathematical logic. Easy read,
sometimes inaccurate. The best part was the notebook at the end. The best idea
is that logic with invalid premises is dangerous.

- 2021-02-13 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
: It's all explained

- 2021-02-10 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
: Snape dispatches Dumbledore

- 2021-02-06 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
: DA

- 2021-01-16 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
: But why did Barty Crouch, impersonating Mad-Eye Moody, teach Harry how to
handle the Imperius curse?

- 2021-01-16 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
: It has a very happy ending.

- 2021-01-01 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
: Oh well, a quick read.
