List of books I've read in 2021

- 2021-05-30 C. Northcote Parkinson: In-laws and Outlaws
: It would be funny advice if it would not be so sexist.

- 2021-02-21 Matt Parker: Humble Pi
: Easy math errors read. The interesting part was about non-transitive odds on
coin sequences.

- 2021-02-14 Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos H. Papadimitriou: Logicomix
: Cartoon on Bertrand Russel's contribution to mathematical logic. Easy read,
sometimes inaccurate. The best part was the notebook at the end. The best idea
is that logic with invalid premises is dangerous.

- 2021-02-13 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
: It's all explained

- 2021-02-10 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
: Snape dispatches Dumbledore

- 2021-02-06 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
: DA

- 2021-01-16 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
: But why did Barty Crouch, impersonating Mad-Eye Moody, teach Harry how to
handle the Imperius curse?

- 2021-01-16 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
: It has a very happy ending.

- 2021-01-01 J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
: Oh well, a quick read.
