# Motivation

---

- continuation
- chains
- sane principles
  - a child coroutine does not outlives its parent
  - a coroutine runs uninterrupted until a co_await
- discuss issue with reference parameters, lambda captures, pointers, string_views
  - the generator problems with scope
- discuss the issue of detach/fire and forget
  - sharing data e.g. by value
  - lifetime
    - discuss bad advice that uses detached models
    - https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rcoro-capture
    - more bad advice https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211103-00/?p=105870
    - though they really like detached in embedded environments, explain why
  - error propagation
- sync start a chain
- wait_any, wait_all
- wait_for
  - stop_when (e.g. on user interrupt instead of timer)
- nursery
