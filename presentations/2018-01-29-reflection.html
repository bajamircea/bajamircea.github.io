# Executive summary

- Reflective metaprogramming = generate code based on code
- We need better reflective metaprogramming facilities in C++
- There are proposals to address it
- It's a complex issue
- Standardisation will likely happen after 2020

---

# Sample problem

---

background-image: url(../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/labrador.jpg)

---

# Data

```json
{
  "name": "Kipper",
  "breed": "Labrador"
}
```

---

# Traditional bad C++ solution

```cpp
class bad_dog
{
private:
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> name_;
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> breed_;

public:
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> get_name();
  void set_name(std::shared_ptr<std::string> value);

  std::shared_ptr<std::string> get_breed();
  void set_breed(std::shared_ptr<std::string> value);

  void init(const Json & doc);
};
```
---
class: large-points

# Issues with this traditional solution

- Reference semantics leading to
- Difficulty of local reasoning and
- Complex memory layout leading to
- Degraded performance
- Getter and setters leading to
- Combinatoric interface
- Init method leading to
- Multi-step initialization
- Multiple responsibilities leading to
- Maintainability and
- Testing difficulties

---

# Bad memory layout

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/bad_dog.png)

---

# Better C++ solution

```cpp
struct dog
{
  std::string name;
  std::string breed;
};


dog dog_from_json(const Json & doc);
```

--

Physical layout:
- dog struct is defined in dog.h
- Serialization in dog_from_json.h and cpp

---

# Memory layout

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/dog.png)

---

# Boilerplate

---

# Deserialization

```cpp
dog dog_from_json(const Json & doc)
{
  dog x;

  x.name = doc['name'].as_string();
  x.breed = doc['breed'].as_string();

  return x;
}
```
--
```cpp
dog dog_from_json(const Json & doc)
{
  return {
    doc['name'].as_string(),
    doc['breed'].as_string()
  };
}
```

---

# Equality

```cpp
bool operator==(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  if (left.name != right.name)
  {
    return false;
  }
  return left.breed == right.breed;
}
```
--
```cpp
bool operator==(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return (left.name == right.name) &&
    (left.breed == right.breed);
}
```

---

# Order

```cpp
bool operator<(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  if (left.name < right.name)
  {
    return true;
  }
  if (left.name > right.name)
  {
    return false;
  }
  return left.breed < right.breed;
}
```
--
```cpp
bool operator<(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  if (left.name != right.name)
  {
    return left.name < right.name;
  }
  return left.breed < right.breed;
}
```

---

# Other comparison operators

```cpp
bool operator!=(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return !(left == right);
}

bool operator<=(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return !(right < left);
}

bool operator>(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return right < left;
}

bool operator>=(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return !(left < right);
}
```

---
class: large-points

# Note

- Implementation on previous slide is not optimal (reason: unnecessary multiple traversal)
- Pure historical reasons for the compiler not implementing comparison operators by default
- Note that equality and comparison do not have the same cost
- Spaceship operator '<=>' proposal

---

# Padding

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/padding.png)

---

# Metaprogramming currently

---

# Tie members alternative

```cpp
auto tie_members(const dog & x) noexcept
{
  return std::tie(x.name, x.breed);
}
// returns a std::tuple<std::string &, std::string &>
```

--
```cpp
bool operator==(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return tie_members(left) == tie_members(right);
}

bool operator<(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return tie_members(left) < tie_members(right);
}

// etc.
```

---

# Tie with (some) check

```cpp
template<class T, typename ... Args>
auto tie_with_check(Args & ... args) noexcept
{
  static_assert(sizeof(T) == sizeof(std::tuple<Args...>),
    "You forgot a member variable");
  return std::tie(args...);
}
```
--
```cpp
auto tie_members(const dog & x) noexcept
{
  return tie_with_check<dog>(x.name, x.breed);
}
```

--

'tuple' is usually implemented using recursive derivation, not as side by
side member declaration as a struct.

Therefore there is no guarantee that std::tuple has the same layout as the struct.

Padding might be different.

---

# Tuple inheritance

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/tuple_inheritance.png)

---

# Struct layout

```cpp
template<typename ... Args>
struct struct_layout;

template<typename T0>
struct struct_layout<T0>
{
  T0 m0;
};

template<typename T0, typename T1>
struct struct_layout<T0, T1>
{
  T0 m0;
  T1 m1;
};

// and so on up to the max number of members you support
```
--
```cpp
  static_assert(sizeof(T) == sizeof(struct_layout<Args...>),
    "You forgot a member variable");
```

class: large-points

# Issues with current metaprogramming in C++

- It looks clever, but it is convoluted
- Relies on the historical accident that the templates machinery is Turing
  complete


- Conditionals ('if') use overloading/template specialization
- Iterations ('for') use recursion (e.g. recursive inheritance)
- Store state as parametrized types and constants
- Instantiate template to trigger the computation

---
class: large-points

# Issues with current reflection support in C++

- Is very limited, relies on overloading, template specialization, concepts


- Can query for types e.g. std::is_pointer
- Can do simple type transformations e.g. std::make_unsigned


- Can't enumerate members
- Can't get names

---
class: large-points

# Other metaprogramming options

- Pre-processor
- constexpr functions
- Other languages/tools outside C++ (e.g. MIDL compiler etc.)

---

# Use cases for better facilities

---
class: large-points

# Use case: common operators

- ==, < implemented lexicographically
- implement !=, <=, >=, >  in terms of the above
- std::hash


## Problems
- Can be do all in one go or piecemeal?
- Some functions are, some function are not members of the class
- std::hash might be in a different namespace (the need to specify where code
  generation takes place)

---
class: large-points

# Use case: serialization

- to/from JSON/XML
- relational database mapping
- logging function arguments
- ASSERT_EQ macro in tests


## Problems
- Getting the current function as input for reflection
- Getting names of the parent context
- Getting source code line of the original construct

---

# Use case: enum to/from string

```cpp
enum class foo_bar
{
  foo,
  bar
};

auto to_string(foo_bar x) noexcept
{
  switch (x)
  {
  case foo_bar::foo:
    return "foo";
  case foo_bar::bar:
    return "bar";
  default:
    std::terminate();
  }
}
```

---
class: large-points

# Use case: transformation

- C structure mapping a C++ structure members
- mock class for a interface
- member functions wrapping (e.g. with logging, locking, pimpl)
- stand alone function wrapping (e.g. variations of error handling)

## Problems
- Which file (even language) is the code generated in
- Dealing with templates (class or function)

---
class: large-points

# Use case: identifiers on the fly

- currently they require macros

- low hanging fruit from the code generation component of the problem

---

# Theory

---
class: large-points

# Reflection workflow

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/reflection_workflow.png)

???

- reflect on a source construct
- analyse
- generate something to execute

the steps above for equality or from_json:
- get a reflection of the class
- get a reflection of each member
- maybe check the type of the member
- generate a code snippet

---

# Static vs dynamic reflection

A lot of languages support dynamic reflection:

- reflection/generation not at compile time
- not a zero-cost abstraction, it forbids optimisations of original source code constructs.
- generation could mean "function invocation" at runtime


For C++ we want static reflection metaprogramming

---

# Static reflection

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/static_reflection.png)

???

- based on a source construct
- the reflection operator returns a description of the source construct
- code generation is based on a description of the source construct
- it all happens at compile time

---

# Domains and operators

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/operator_domains.png)

---

# Input domain

Yes:
- class
  - data members
  - member functions
  - member types
- enumerators: e.g. serialization for enums
- functions (overloads?)

Maybe:
- variables
- class templates and function templates
- attributes

Probably not:
- expressions

---

# Reflection result

Options:
- unique type for each reflection
- objects, but still of unique type for each reflection
- objects of a single type e.g. std::meta::info

Metadata:
- name (e.g. name of a class)
- list of members
- arguments of a function
- etc.

---
class: large-points

# Code generation options

- existing template metaprogramming
- raw string (powerful, but could be opaque)
- token sequence (e.g. -> { ...code here...})
- abstract syntax tree creation API
- associate a name as a shorthand for code generation (e.g. metaclasses)

---

# P0194, P0385
by Matus Chochlik, Axel Naumann, David Sankel

Type-based reflection with template metaprogramming

- Uses 'reflexpr' as the reflection operator
- Yields a new type for each reflection
- Properties are static members of the class
- Code generation operators are type traits or 'unreflexpr' for more complex cases

Advantages:
- Powerful
- Few additions to language, few compiler intrinsics

Disadvantages:
- But has downside of using templates machinery to perform
  computation (complex style compared with plain C++ programming)
- A lot of classes generated: low compile time performance

---

# P0385 sample (part 1)


```cpp
template<typename T>
struct compare_data_members
{
  ...
};

template<typename T>
bool generic_equal(const T & a, const T & b)
{
  using metaT = $reflect(T);
  bool result = true;

  reflect::for_each<reflect::get_data_members_t<metaT>>(
    compare_data_members<T>{a, b, result});

  return result;
}
```

---

# P0385 sample (part 2)


```cpp
template<typename T>
struct compare_data_members
{
  const T & a;
  const T & b;
  bool & result;

  template<reflect::Object MetaDataMember>
  void operator ()(MetaDataMember) const
  {
    auto mem_ptr = reflect::get_pointer_v<MetaDataMember>;
    result &= a.*mem_ptr == b.*mem_ptr;
  }
};
```

---

# P0590, P0589, P0712
by Andrew Sutton, Herb Sutter

Type-based reflection with heterogenous containers

- Uses $ as the reflection operator
- $ applies to: variables, types, namespaces, functions
- The return type depends on what was reflected on (it's a template
  specialization, but you would use auto all the time anyway)
- Properties are static constexpr members
- Code generation operators as 'typename', 'namespace', 'idexpr'

- Requires more compiler intrinsics
- Because they are template specialization properties are not instantiated
  until called (sometimes good, sometimes bad)
- Getting class members returns a heterogenous tuple-like container

Disadvantages:
- Still generates a lot of types: resource intensive compiler and complex usage style

---

# Plumbing

---

# Reflection operator $

```cpp
void foo(int n) {
  int x;
  auto r1 = $int; // r1 has type meta::fundamental_type<X>
  auto r2 = $foo; // r2 has type meta::function<X>
  auto r3 = $n; // r3 has type meta::parameter<X>
  auto r4 = $x; // r4 has type meta::variable<X>
}
```

---

# Heterogenous 'for' loop

Aka. unrolled loop, loop expansion, tuple-based for loop

```cpp
for... (auto x : $s.member_variables())
{
  std::cout << x.name();
}
```

--
Expands to

```cpp
auto && tup = $s.member_variables();
{ auto x = std::get<0>(tup); cout << x.name(); }
{ auto x = std::get<1>(tup); cout << x.name(); }
```

---

# Existing constexpr

```cpp
constexpr int one_bigger(int x)
{
  return ++x;
}

int some_array[one_bigger(6)];

int main(int /*argc*/, char * argv[])
{
  std::cout << std::size(some_array) << '\n';

  int argument = std::stoi(argv[1]);
  int result = one_bigger(argument);
  std::cout << result << '\n';
}
```

---
class: large-points

# constexpr vs immediate

- constexpr means 'it can be used at compile time'
- constexpr does not mean 'it will be used at compile time'

---

# constexpr blocks

```cpp
constexpr
{
  // do some compile time programming here
}
```

Can be placed in namespace, class, block scope.

--

Equivalent to:

```cpp
constexpr void __unnamed_fn()
{
  // compile time code here
}
constexpr int __unnamed_var = (__unnamed_fn(), 0);
```

---

# Injection statement

Can appear inside a constexpr block

```cpp
constexpr
{
  -> namespace { int f() { return 0; } }
} // injection site is here
```

--
Equivalent to:
```cpp
int f() { return 0; }
```

--

Several options for the scope of the injection: namespace, class, block,
expression.

---

# All together now

```cpp
template<Enum E>
const char * to_string(E value)
{
  switch(value)
  constexpr {
    for... (auto e : $E.enumerators())
    {
      -> { case e.value(): return e.name(); }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Identifier generation

```cpp
void foo() { ...  }

void foo_bar() { ... }

void g()
{
  auto x = $foo;
  return declname(x "_bar")();
}
```

---
class: large-points

# Other plumbing

- std::const_vector
- Handling strings at compile time
- Custom error messages (diagnostic)
- Print generated constructs (diagnostic)

---

# Named constexpr blocks

```cpp
constexpr void make_links()
{
  -> class C
  {
    C * next;
    C * prev;
  }
}

struct list
{
  constexpr { make_links(); }
};
```

--
Equivalent to:
```cpp
struct list
{
  list * next;
  list * prev;
};
```

---

# Upstairs

---

# Metaclass sample (part 1)

```cpp
$class interface
{
  constexpr {
    compiler.require($interface.variables().empty(),
      "interfaces may not contain data");
    for (auto f : $interface.functions())
    {
      compiler.require(!f.is_copy() && !f.is_move(),
         "interfaces may not copy or move; consider a "
         " virtual clone() instead");
      if (!f.has_access()) f.make_public();
      compiler.require(f.is_public(),
        "interface functions must be public");
      f.make_pure_virtual();
    }
  }
  virtual ~interface() noexcept { }
};
```

---

# Metaclass sample (part 2)

```cpp
interface Shape
{
  int area() const;
  void scale_by(double factor);
};
```

---
class: large-points

# Alternatives: Source to destination class

- change in place
- two types
- two types (source is hidden)


---

# .is and .as

```cpp
struct legacy_point { int x; int y; }; // in C++17 this is not comparable...

set<legacy_point> s; // and so this is an error

using ordered_point = $legacy_point.as(ordered); // ... but this is ordered
set<ordered_point> s; // so this is OK
```

---

# P0707 Metaclasses
by Herb Sutter

Advantages:
- ability to create constructs that currently require new language features
  like 'enum class'
- $T.as(M) is very powerful
- composes (e.g. using inheritance syntax

Maybe disadvantage:
- a bit too class oriented (e.g. friend trick)

---

# Metaclass sample (part 3)

```cpp
$class ordered
{
  constexpr {
    if (! requires(ordered a) { a == a; })
    -> {
      friend bool operator == (const ordered& a, const ordered& b) {
        constexpr {
          for (auto o : ordered.variables())
          -> { if (!(a.o.name$ == b.(o.name)$)) return false; }
        }
        return true;
      }
    }
  //...
  }
};
```

---

# Metaclass sample (part 4)

```cpp
ordered dog
{
  std::string name;
  std::string breed;
};
```
---

# Observations

---
class: large-points

# Relation to template metaprogramming

- Reflective metaprogramming has the potential to replace most/all usage of
  template metaprogramming (but not clear to what degree)

---
class: large-points

# Relation to D lang introspection

- What Andrei Alexandrescu called the need for compile time introspection
  facilities, criticising the concepts spec for C++
- Similarly Andrei Alexandrescu demonstrates the ability to develop new
  features like bit-fields using existing language constructs rather than
  having to add new language extensions (with metaclasses in particular)

---
class: large-points

# Similarities to template instantiation

- Especially when we get to code generation at what time the metadata is
  captured, at what point evaluated?
- Entity is not yet complete inside member function of a class
- Or inside of a function ... what is the return type if auto?
- Or inside a template function

---
class: large-points

# Famous last words

- It can be misused
- But it can be used for good as well:  high return feature to eliminate boilerplate and most template programming
- Tooling improvements required
