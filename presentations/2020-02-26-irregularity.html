Mircea Baja @ ACCU Oxford - 26 Feb 2020

# Irregularity in generic programming

???

The original idea of this talk is that diversity in data structures and
algorithms results in generic solutions being quirky and not universal (the
irregularity conjecture).

To get there, we're going to have a bit of fun with simple data structures
(linked lists) and simple algorithms (linear find and partition), see what
(C++20) concepts are, to build towards the more philosophical part
on the design and usage of generic code.

# Objective

- What is irregularity?
- What is regularity?
- The naming quirks
- The irregularity continuum
- The irregularity conjecture
- A list/vector is just a kind of list/vector

---
class: large-points

# The vector theorem

- Theorem: `std::vector` is just a kind of vector (Alex Stepanov)

--
- Lemma: `std::list` is just a kind of linked list
- However, if you can only remember one thing: you shall use a `std::vector` by
  default (i.e. a memory contiguous data structure, the linked lists are for
  rare special situations)

--
- Many choices for linked lists, not all independent (orthogonal)

# Dummy node

- meaning (end iterator, none/simplify empty list case)
- location (heap, header)
- if on the heap: always present?
- can dereference/does it have a value?

---
class: large-points

# More

- Permanent end iterator
- Forward/Bidirectional iterator
- Intrusive/non-intrusive
- Iterator from reference to value
- Node ownership
- Allocators
- Meaning of node pointers
- Thread safety

---

# Single linked basic

![Image](../assets/2018-06-28-linked-lists-examples/01-single-basic.png)

- no constant time `push_back()`
- `std::forward_list`

# Single linked summary

- the price to pay for constant time `push_back()` either: iterator not
  minimalistic OR header not minimalistic

Irregularity is the property of generic data structures and algorithms of being
quirky and avoiding universality. 

- Euclid's Elements
- Stepanov's Elements of Programming
- Regularity is a fundamental concept
- In practice, various degrees of regularity

Diversity in data structures and algorithms and consequences for generic
solutions: the irregularity continuum and the irregularity conjecture (that
generic solutions are quirky and escape universality)

# Sample problem

---

background-image: url(../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/labrador.jpg)

---

# Data

```json
{
  "name": "Kipper",
  "breed": "Labrador"
}
```

---

# Traditional bad C++ solution

```cpp
class bad_dog
{
private:
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> name_;
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> breed_;

public:
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> get_name();
  void set_name(std::shared_ptr<std::string> value);

  std::shared_ptr<std::string> get_breed();
  void set_breed(std::shared_ptr<std::string> value);

  void init(const Json & doc);
};
```
---
class: large-points

# Issues with this traditional solution

- Reference semantics leading to
- Difficulty of local reasoning and
- Complex memory layout leading to
- Degraded performance
- Getter and setters leading to
- Combinatoric interface
- Init method leading to
- Multi-step initialization
- Multiple responsibilities leading to
- Maintainability and
- Testing difficulties

---

# Bad memory layout

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/bad_dog.png)

---

# Better C++ solution

```cpp
struct dog
{
  std::string name;
  std::string breed;
};


dog dog_from_json(const Json & doc);
```

--

Physical layout:
- dog struct is defined in dog.h
- Serialization in dog_from_json.h and cpp

---

# Memory layout

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/dog.png)

---

# Boilerplate

---

# Deserialization

```cpp
dog dog_from_json(const Json & doc)
{
  dog x;

  x.name = doc['name'].as_string();
  x.breed = doc['breed'].as_string();

  return x;
}
```
--
```cpp
dog dog_from_json(const Json & doc)
{
  return {
    doc['name'].as_string(),
    doc['breed'].as_string()
  };
}
```

---

# Equality

```cpp
bool operator==(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  if (left.name != right.name)
  {
    return false;
  }
  return left.breed == right.breed;
}
```
--
```cpp
bool operator==(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return (left.name == right.name) &&
    (left.breed == right.breed);
}
```

---

# Order

```cpp
bool operator<(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  if (left.name < right.name)
  {
    return true;
  }
  if (left.name > right.name)
  {
    return false;
  }
  return left.breed < right.breed;
}
```
--
```cpp
bool operator<(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  if (left.name != right.name)
  {
    return left.name < right.name;
  }
  return left.breed < right.breed;
}
```

---

# Other comparison operators

```cpp
bool operator!=(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return !(left == right);
}

bool operator<=(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return !(right < left);
}

bool operator>(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return right < left;
}

bool operator>=(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return !(left < right);
}
```

---
class: large-points

# Note

- Implementation on previous slide is not optimal (reason: unnecessary multiple traversal)
- Spaceship operator '<=>' proposal
- Note that equality and comparison do not have the same cost
- Pure historical reasons for the compiler not implementing comparison operators by default

---

# Padding

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/padding.png)

---

# Metaprogramming currently

---

# Tie members alternative

```cpp
auto tie_members(const dog & x) noexcept
{
  return std::tie(x.name, x.breed);
}
// returns a std::tuple<const std::string &, const std::string &>
```

--
```cpp
bool operator==(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return tie_members(left) == tie_members(right);
}

bool operator<(const dog & left, const dog & right) noexcept
{
  return tie_members(left) < tie_members(right);
}

// etc.
```

---

# Tie with (some) check

```cpp
template<class T, typename ... Args>
auto tie_with_check(Args & ... args) noexcept
{
  static_assert(sizeof(T) == sizeof(std::tuple<Args...>),
    "You forgot a member variable");
  return std::tie(args...);
}
```
--
```cpp
auto tie_members(const dog & x) noexcept
{
  return tie_with_check<dog>(x.name, x.breed);
}
```

--

'tuple' is usually implemented using recursive derivation, not as side by
side member declaration as a struct.

Therefore there is no guarantee that std::tuple has the same layout as the struct.

Padding might be different.

---

# Tuple inheritance

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/tuple_inheritance.png)

---

# Struct layout

```cpp
template<typename ... Args>
struct struct_layout;

template<typename T0>
struct struct_layout<T0>
{
  T0 m0;
};

template<typename T0, typename T1>
struct struct_layout<T0, T1>
{
  T0 m0;
  T1 m1;
};

// and so on up to the max number of members you support
```
--
```cpp
  static_assert(sizeof(T) == sizeof(struct_layout<Args...>),
    "You forgot a member variable");
```

# Issues with current metaprogramming in C++

- It looks clever, but it is convoluted


- Conditionals ('if') use overloading/template specialization
- Iterations ('for') use recursion (e.g. recursive inheritance)
- Store state as parametrized types and constants
- Instantiate template to trigger the computation


- Relies on the historical accident that the templates machinery is Turing
  complete

---
class: large-points

# Issues with current reflection support in C++

- Can query for types e.g. std::is_pointer
- Can do simple type transformations e.g. std::make_unsigned


- But is very limited, relies on overloading, template specialization, concepts


- Can't enumerate members
- Can't get names

---
class: large-points

# Other metaprogramming options

- Pre-processor
- constexpr functions
- Other languages/tools outside C++ (e.g. MIDL compiler etc.)

---

# Use cases for better facilities

---
class: large-points

# Use case: common operators

- ==, < implemented lexicographically
- implement !=, <=, >=, >  in terms of the above
- std::hash


## Problems
- Can be do all in one go or piecemeal?
- Some functions are, some function are not members of the class
- std::hash might be in a different namespace (the need to specify where code
  generation takes place)

---
class: large-points

# Use case: serialization

- to/from JSON/XML
- relational database mapping
- logging function arguments
- ASSERT_EQ macro in tests


## Problems
- Getting the current function as input for reflection
- Getting names of the parent context
- Getting source code line of the original construct

---

# Use case: enum to/from string

```cpp
enum class foo_bar
{
  foo,
  bar
};

auto to_string(foo_bar x) noexcept
{
  switch (x)
  {
  case foo_bar::foo:
    return "foo";
  case foo_bar::bar:
    return "bar";
  default:
    std::terminate();
  }
}
```

---
class: large-points

# Use case: transformation

- C structure mapping a C++ structure members
- mock class for a interface
- member functions wrapping (e.g. with logging, locking, pimpl)
- stand alone function wrapping (e.g. variations of error handling)

## Problems
- Which file (even language) is the code generated in
- Dealing with templates (class or function)

---
class: large-points

# Use case: identifiers on the fly

- currently they require macros

- low hanging fruit from the code generation component of the problem

---

# Theory

---
class: large-points

# Reflection workflow

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/reflection_workflow.png)

???

- reflect on a source construct
- analyse
- generate something to execute

the steps above for equality or from_json:
- get a reflection of the class
- get a reflection of each member
- maybe check the type of the member
- generate a code snippet

---

# Static vs dynamic reflection

A lot of languages support dynamic reflection:

- reflection/generation not at compile time
- not a zero-cost abstraction, it forbids optimisations of original source code constructs.
- generation could mean "function invocation" at runtime


For C++ we want static reflection metaprogramming

---

# Static reflection

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/static_reflection.png)

???

- based on a source construct
- the reflection operator returns a description of the source construct
- code generation is based on a description of the source construct
- it all happens at compile time

---

# Domains and operators

![Image](../assets/2018-01-29-reflection/operator_domains.png)

---

# Input domain

Yes:
- class
  - data members
  - member functions
  - member types
- enumerators: e.g. serialization for enums
- functions (overloads?)

Maybe:
- variables
- class templates and function templates
- attributes

Probably not:
- expressions

---

# Reflection result

Metadata:
- name (e.g. name of a class)
- list of members
- arguments of a function
- etc.

Options:
- unique type for each reflection
- objects, but still of unique type for each reflection
- objects of a single type e.g. std::meta::info

---
class: large-points

# Code generation options

- existing template metaprogramming
- raw string (powerful, but could be opaque)
- abstract syntax tree creation API
- token sequence (e.g. -> { ...code here...})
- associate a name as a shorthand for code generation (e.g. metaclasses)

# P0194, P0385
by Matus Chochlik, Axel Naumann, David Sankel

Type-based reflection with template metaprogramming

- Uses 'reflexpr' as the reflection operator
- Yields a new type for each reflection
- Properties are static members of the class
- Code generation operators are type traits or 'unreflexpr' for more complex cases

Advantages:
- Powerful
- Few additions to language, few compiler intrinsics

Disadvantages:
- But has downside of using templates machinery to perform
  computation (complex style compared with plain C++ programming)
- A lot of classes generated: low compile time performance

---

# P0385 sample (part 1)


```cpp
template<typename T>
struct compare_data_members
{
  ...
};

template<typename T>
bool generic_equal(const T & a, const T & b)
{
  using metaT = $reflect(T);
  bool result = true;

  reflect::for_each<reflect::get_data_members_t<metaT>>(
    compare_data_members<T>{a, b, result});

  return result;
}
```

---

# P0385 sample (part 2)


```cpp
template<typename T>
struct compare_data_members
{
  const T & a;
  const T & b;
  bool & result;

  template<reflect::Object MetaDataMember>
  void operator ()(MetaDataMember) const
  {
    auto mem_ptr = reflect::get_pointer_v<MetaDataMember>;
    result &= a.*mem_ptr == b.*mem_ptr;
  }
};
```

---

# P0590, P0589, P0712
by Andrew Sutton, Herb Sutter

Type-based reflection with heterogenous containers

- Uses $ as the reflection operator
- $ applies to: variables, types, namespaces, functions
- The return type depends on what was reflected on (it's a template
  specialization, but you would use auto all the time anyway)
- Properties are static constexpr members
- Code generation operators as 'typename', 'namespace', 'idexpr'

- Requires more compiler intrinsics
- Because they are template specialization properties are not instantiated
  until called (sometimes good, sometimes bad)
- Getting class members returns a heterogenous tuple-like container

Disadvantages:
- Still generates a lot of types: resource intensive compiler and complex usage style

---

# Plumbing

---

# Reflection operator $

```cpp
void foo(int n) {
  int x;
  auto r1 = $int; // r1 has type meta::fundamental_type<X>
  auto r2 = $foo; // r2 has type meta::function<X>
  auto r3 = $n; // r3 has type meta::parameter<X>
  auto r4 = $x; // r4 has type meta::variable<X>
}
```

---

# Heterogenous 'for' loop

Aka. unrolled loop, loop expansion, tuple-based for loop

```cpp
for... (auto x : $s.member_variables())
{
  std::cout << x.name();
}
```

--
Expands to

```cpp
auto && tup = $s.member_variables();
{ auto x = std::get<0>(tup); cout << x.name(); }
{ auto x = std::get<1>(tup); cout << x.name(); }
```

---

# Existing constexpr

```cpp
constexpr int one_bigger(int x)
{
  return ++x;
}

int some_array[one_bigger(6)];

int main(int /*argc*/, char * argv[])
{
  std::cout << std::size(some_array) << '\n';

  int argument = std::stoi(argv[1]);
  int result = one_bigger(argument);
  std::cout << result << '\n';
}
```

---
class: large-points

# constexpr vs immediate

- constexpr means 'it can be used at compile time'
- constexpr does not mean 'it will be used at compile time'

---

# constexpr blocks

```cpp
constexpr
{
  // do some compile time programming here
}
```

Can be placed in namespace, class, block scope.

--

Equivalent to:

```cpp
constexpr void __unnamed_fn()
{
  // compile time code here
}
constexpr int __unnamed_var = (__unnamed_fn(), 0);
```

---

# Injection statement

Can appear inside a constexpr block

```cpp
constexpr
{
  -> namespace { int f() { return 0; } }
} // injection site is here
```

--
Equivalent to:
```cpp
int f() { return 0; }
```

--

Several options for the scope of the injection: namespace, class, block,
expression.

---

# All together now

```cpp
template<Enum E>
const char * to_string(E value)
{
  switch(value)
  constexpr {
    for... (auto e : $E.enumerators())
    {
      -> { case e.value(): return e.name(); }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Identifier generation

```cpp
void foo() { ...  }

void foo_bar() { ... }

void g()
{
  auto x = $foo;
  return declname(x "_bar")();
}
```

---
class: large-points

# Other plumbing

- std::const_vector
- Handling strings at compile time
- Custom error messages (diagnostic)
- Print generated constructs (diagnostic)

---

# Named constexpr blocks

```cpp
constexpr void make_links()
{
  -> class C
  {
    C * next;
    C * prev;
  }
}

struct list
{
  constexpr { make_links(); }
};
```

--
Equivalent to:
```cpp
struct list
{
  list * next;
  list * prev;
};
```

---

# Upstairs

---

# Metaclass sample (part 1)

```cpp
$class interface
{
  constexpr {
    compiler.require($interface.variables().empty(),
      "interfaces may not contain data");
    for (auto f : $interface.functions())
    {
      compiler.require(!f.is_copy() && !f.is_move(),
         "interfaces may not copy or move; consider a "
         " virtual clone() instead");
      if (!f.has_access()) f.make_public();
      compiler.require(f.is_public(),
        "interface functions must be public");
      f.make_pure_virtual();
    }
  }
  virtual ~interface() noexcept { }
};
```

---

# Metaclass sample (part 2)

```cpp
interface Shape
{
  int area() const;
  void scale_by(double factor);
};
```

---
class: large-points

# Alternatives: Source to destination class

- change in place
- two types
- two types (source is hidden)


---

# .is and .as

```cpp
struct legacy_point { int x; int y; }; // in C++17 this is not comparable...

set<legacy_point> s; // and so this is an error

using ordered_point = $legacy_point.as(ordered); // ... but this is ordered
set<ordered_point> s; // so this is OK
```

---

# P0707 Metaclasses
by Herb Sutter

Advantages:
- ability to create constructs that currently require new language features
  like 'enum class'
- $T.as(M) is very powerful
- composes (e.g. using inheritance syntax

Maybe disadvantage:
- a bit too class oriented (e.g. friend trick)

---

# Metaclass sample (part 3)

```cpp
$class ordered
{
  constexpr {
    if (! requires(ordered a) { a == a; })
    -> {
      friend bool operator == (const ordered& a, const ordered& b) {
        constexpr {
          for (auto o : ordered.variables())
          -> { if (!(a.o.name$ == b.(o.name)$)) return false; }
        }
        return true;
      }
    }
  //...
  }
};
```

---

# Metaclass sample (part 4)

```cpp
ordered dog
{
  std::string name;
  std::string breed;
};
```
---

# Observations

---
class: large-points

# Relation to template metaprogramming

- Reflective metaprogramming has the potential to replace most/all usage of
  template metaprogramming (but not clear to what degree)

---
class: large-points

# Relation to D lang introspection

- What Andrei Alexandrescu called the need for compile time introspection
  facilities, criticising the concepts spec for C++
- Similarly Andrei Alexandrescu demonstrates the ability to develop new
  features like bit-fields using existing language constructs rather than
  having to add new language extensions (with metaclasses in particular)

---
class: large-points

# Similarities to template instantiation

- Especially when we get to code generation at what time the metadata is
  captured, at what point evaluated?
- Entity is not yet complete inside member function of a class
- Or inside of a function ... what is the return type if auto?
- Or inside a template function

---
class: large-points

# Famous last words

- It can be misused
- But it can be used for good as well:  high return feature to eliminate boilerplate and most template programming
- Tooling improvements required
