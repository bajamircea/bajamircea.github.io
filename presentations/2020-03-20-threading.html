Mircea Baja @ 20 March 2020

# Advanced Introduction to Multithreading

- Advanced in that it assumes audience used/heard of threads
- Introduction in that the subject is deep and complex
- "we're doing this thing that we shouldn't be do it, is it all right if we keep
  on doing it?"

# Demo

- Single threaded Fibonacci
- Exponential version takes "0 milliseconds"


---

# Fibonacci

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>
#include <iostream>

int fib(int x)
{
    if (x < 2) return 1;
    return fib(x - 1) + fib(x - 2);
}

int main()
{
    auto start = ::GetTickCount();
    int result = fib(42);
    auto stop = ::GetTickCount();
    std::cout << result << '\n';
    std::cout << "It took: " << (stop - start) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
433494437
It took: 0
```

# Generated code

```asm
    12:     auto start = ::GetTickCount();
 mov         esi,dword ptr [__imp__GetTickCount@0 (09B3000h)]
 push        edi
 call        esi
 mov         edi,eax
    14:     auto stop = ::GetTickCount();
 call        esi
    13:     int result = fib(42);
 mov         ecx,29h
    14:     auto stop = ::GetTickCount();
 mov         esi,eax
    13:     int result = fib(42);
 call        fib (09B1000h)
 mov         ecx,28h
 mov         edx,eax
 call        fib (09B1000h)
```

- reordered (not for "external" functions)
- interleaved

---

# DAG

- undefined (but maybe deterministic, unfeasable though for any but the most trivial cases)

---

# The CPU memory model sample

- memory at `x` and `y` starts at 0

- one thread:

```asm
 mov [x],1   ; store 1 at the location x in memory
 mov eax,[y] ; load value from location y in memory to register eax
```

- another thread:

```asm
 mov [y],1   ; store 1 at the location y in memory
 mov ebx,[x] ; load value from location x in memory to register ebx
```

- what are the possible outcomes for values in `eax` and `ebx`

--

- they can also end up 0

# CPU issues

- Speculative execution
- Data dependency ordering (DEC Alpha)
- Weak and strong memory models


- writes can be reordered ahead of other reads
- writes can be reordered ahead of other writes
- reads can be reordered ahead of other reads
- reads can be reordered ahead of other writes (x86)


- x86 ... ARM/PowerPC ... DEC Alpha
- "Weak/strong" memory model - it's a simplification

---

# TSO for x86

![Image](../assets/2019-10-25-cpu-memory-model/tso.png)

- Lock free is not synchronization free

---

# Memory barrier


![Image](../assets/2019-10-25-cpu-memory-model/mem-fence-motivation.png)


- write-release: e.g. ensure that all writes are performed BEFORE the write to the flag.
- read-acquire: e.g. ensure that all reads are performed AFTER the read of the flag.


- sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit

# Threading before C++11

```cpp
DWORD WINAPI ThreadFn(LPVOID)
{
    return 0;
}

int main()
{
    int result = fib(39);
    auto m = ::CreateMutexW(NULL,NULL,NULL);
    result = fib(40);
    auto h = ::CreateThread(NULL, 0, ThreadFn, &result, 0, NULL);
    result = fib(41);
    ::WaitForSingleObject(m, INFINITE);
    result = fib(42);
    ::ReleaseMutex(m);
    ::WaitForSingleObject(h, INFINITE);
    std::cout << result << '\n';
    return 0;
}

```

# DAG

![Image](../assets/2019-10-29-threading-before-cpp11/graph.png)

- can't provide lightweight synchronization primitives without compiler support
- historic struggles for Linux kernel locks, Java VM garbage collectors
- when the compiler performs optimisations, threading cannot be implemented as
  a library: it requires compiler support/guarantees

---

# Without appropriate synchronization, access to the same data from multiple threads, with at least of one of them writing, is undefined.

- C++11 data race
- The language memory model is very weak (think DEC Alpha) allowing scope for
  optimisations
- Just because it seems to work, it does not mean that it really works and itâ€™s
  not just a bug waiting to happen

---

# Yes but myth

![Image](../assets/2019-10-31-cpp-data-race/not-atomic.png)

---

# Integer data race

```cpp
// Given two `int` variables `x` and `y` set initially to `0`:

// Thread 1:
if (x != 0) {
  ++y;
}

// Thread 2:
if (y != 0) {
  ++x;
}
```
---

# Integer data race - part 2

```cpp
// Thread 1:
++y;
if (x == 0) {
  --y;
}

// Thread 2:
++x;
if (y == 0) {
  --x;
}
```
---

# Boolean data race

```cpp
// given a `bool` variable set initially to `false`

// Thread 1:
while (!stop) {
  // do work
}

// Thread 2:
stop = true;
```
---

# Boolean data race - part 2

```cpp
// Thread 1:
if (!stop) {
  while (true) {
    // do work
  }
}

// Thread 2:
stop = true;
```
---

# Mutex locking

- `unlock()` synchronizes with any subsequent `lock()` operations that obtain
  ownership of the same `std::mutex`

![Image](../assets/2019-11-02-cpp11-synchronizes-with/mutex.png)

---

# Thread creation

- the completion of the invocation of the `std::thread` constructor
  synchronizes with the beginning of the invocation of thread function

![Image](../assets/2019-11-02-cpp11-synchronizes-with/creation.png)

---

# Thread completion

- the completion of the `std::thread` synchronizes with the corresponding
  successful `join()` return

![Image](../assets/2019-11-02-cpp11-synchronizes-with/join.png)

---

# Volatile

![Image](../assets/2019-11-05-cpp11-volatile/mappedio.png)

- generate reads or writes to memory addresses for assignments to `volatile`
  qualified variables, instead of optimising them away
- preserve the order of assignments to `volatile` qualified variables, ensuring
  they are not reordered

---

# The volatile myth

```cpp
int a = 0;
int b = 0;
bool flag = false;

void producer_thread()
{
  // write a and b
  a = 42;
  b = 43;
  // set the flag at the end
  flag = true;
}

void consumer_thread()
{
  // wait for the flag to be set
  while (!flag) continue;
  // the flag was set: use a and b
  ...
}
```

- "Just" qualify the `flag` as `volatile`

# Developer hopes

---

# Reality

![Image](../assets/2019-11-05-cpp11-volatile/without-mem-fence.png)


---

# Volatile in practice

- Java and C# - volatile is atomic and adds full memory fences

- In C++11 volatile does not guarantee memory barriers for non-volatile access

- Microsoft Visual C++: `/volatile:ms` OR `/volatile:iso`

- Meaning of volatile changed over time ... and will continue to do so

---

# The thread sandwich

- keep it (relatively) simple in order to be able to reason about correctness
- if you need all the info in this thread to reason about multithreading
  correctness, you've probably over-extended
- different applications have very different threading (and error handling)
  requirements
- the thread sandwich pattern splits threading code into 3 components
  (control/queue, function body, underlying thread)
