# Concurrent vs. parallel

# Sequential

# Concurrent

- purple and yellow end later

# Sequential

# Parallel

<div align="center">
{% include assets/2023-06-23-cpp-coroutines/02-parallel.svg %}
</div>

- there is additional overhead (not illustrated)

- Melvin Conway: Design of a separable transition-diagram compiler
- of Conway law fame: product design mirrors organisation structure
- motivation: single pass compiler in memory constraints environments, each
  "coroutine" can output zero or more than one results each time it's invoked
- in the meantime: better ways of designing a compiler

# Simulations

- Bjarne Stroustrup: A Set of C Classes for Co−routine Style Programming.
Bell Laboratories Computer Science Technical Report CSTR−90. November 1980.
- motivation: event driven simulations
- `task` base class used to represent a independent activity which:
  - suspends voluntarily
  - can be resumed, canceled
  - can wait, sleep
  - provides an `int` result and communicates with other `task`s (e.g. producer
    and consumer, server reading from a queue)
  - work is done in the derived class constructor
- one of the earliest libraries in C++ (think `complex` and `string` without
  templates), yet did not make it to the standard
- some of the problems it tries to solve turn out to be recurring

# GUI

```cpp
BOOL bRet;

while( (bRet = GetMessage( &msg, hWnd, 0, 0 )) != 0)
{
  if (bRet == -1)
  {
    // handle the error and possibly exit
  }
  else
  {
    TranslateMessage(&msg); 
    DispatchMessage(&msg); 
  }
}
```

---

# GUI

- usually single threaded: a single dedicated UI thread
- the thread has a queue
- the thread is blocked waiting for a message from the queue
- when a message is returned the thread processes it via a `switch` statements
- messages are added to the queue via `PostMessage` (from the same thread) or
  `PostThreadMessage` (from a different thread)
- there is also a special "quit" message

# Async IO

# Generator

```cpp
struct fib_state {
  int x_1 = 1;
  int x_2 = 0;
};

int next_fib(fib_state & state) {
  int val = state.x_1 + state.x_2;
  state.x_2 = state.x_1;
  state.x_1 = val;
  return val;
}

void foo() {
  fib_state state;
  while (true) {
    int x = next_fib(state);
    // use x
  }
}
```
---

# Generator

```cpp
generator fib() {
  int x_1 = 1;
  int x_2 = 0;
  while (true) {
    int val = x_1 + x_2;
    yield val;
    x_2 = x_1;
    x_1 = val;
  }
}

void foo() {
  for (int x: fib()) {
    // use x
  }
}
```

- `val` is `yield`ed before `x_2` and `x_1` are updated

---

# Generator

```cpp
std::generator<int> fib() {
  int x_1 = 1;
  int x_2 = 0;
  while (true) {
    int val = x_1 + x_2;
    co_yield val;
    x_2 = x_1;
    x_1 = val;
  }
}

void foo() {
  for (int x: fib()) {
    // use x
  }
}
```
