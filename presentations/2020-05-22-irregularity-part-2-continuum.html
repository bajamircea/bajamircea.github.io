# Iterators: generalized pointers

![Image](../assets/2020-04-06-how-vector-works-array/01-array.png)

- do not dereference the "end" position in an array (one past the last)
- generalization: input/output/forward/bidirectional/random access iterators
  (e.g. position of node in a linked list)
- dummy nodes in lists (usually) don't have values

---

# Linear find with pointers - toy

```cpp
int data[] = {2, 5, 7, 1, 22};

int * it = find(std::begin(data), std::end(data), 5);
if (it == std::end(data)) {
  // not found ...
}
else {
  // found ...
  *it = 42;
}
```

```cpp
int * find(int * f, int * l, int x) {
  while ((f != l) && (*f != x)) ++f;
  return f;
}
```

- Note we compare f with l twice: inside the `find` and outside
- In this case once with `!=`, the other time with `==`
- In well written code the safety issues do not propagate forever

---

# Linear find canonical - toy

```cpp
template<typename It, typename T>
It find(It f, It l, const T & x) {
  while ((f != l) && (*f != x)) ++f;
  return f;
}
```

- When does it work?
- It will work for `T` being `int`, `short`, `long`, `unsigned` etc.
- `It` is pointer-like `first` and `last` to sequences of integer-like values
  (e.g. `T *`)
- `It` can also be an iterator in a linked list
- `T` and `It` are integer-like not in the addition/multiplication sense, but
  in the it holds a value that can be copied, compared for equality etc.

---
class: large-points

# Requirements syntactic

- We can compare for equality `f` and `l`
- We can dereference `f`
- The iterator type has an associated value type
- Dereferencing `f` is reference to the value type
- We can advance `f` (with `++`)
- These are easy to express
- These apply to types, not values

---
class: large-points

# Requirements semantic

- Once `f` equals `l`, it stays that way, we can compare again and get the same
  result
- And that's true even for a copy of `f`
- Equality: reflexive, symmetric and transitive
- We can reach `l` from `f`, `l` should not be dereferenced
- These are harder to express

---

# Linear find using concepts - toy

```cpp
template<typename It>
using ValueType = typename It::value_type;

template<typename It>
concept InputIterator = requires(It a, It b)
{
    {a == b} -> std::boolean;
    {a != b} -> std::boolean;
    typename ValueType<It>;
    {*a} -> std::common_reference_with<ValueType<It>>;
    ++a;
};

template<typename It>
  requires InputIterator<It>
It find(It f, It l, const ValueType<It> & x)
{
    while ((f != l) && (*f != x)) ++f;
    return f;
}
```

- Still toy example (arrays?)

---

# Linear find - industrial version

```cpp
template<InputIterator It, Sentinel<It> S, class T, class Proj = ranges::identity >
  requires IndirectRelation<ranges::equal_to<>, projected<It, Proj>, const T*>
It find(It f, S l, const T& x, Proj proj = Proj{})
{
  while ((f != l) && (ranges::invoke(proj, *f) != x)) ++f;
  return f;
}
```

- Sentinel supports iterators stopping on file end, zero terminated strings. In
  general the case where checking for the end is different from equality of two
  iterators.
- Projections support the case where only part of the value type is used
- Type `T` is not necessarily the value type of the iterator
- Overloaded to get a `range` e.g. the whole container

```cpp
std::cout << std::find(people, "Alice", &person::first_name)->last_name;
```
---

# Faster linear find

```cpp
template<typename It, typename T>
// requires It is an ForwardIterator
//   T is equality comparable with ValueType<It>,
//   T is assignable to ValueType<It>
It find_by_setting_sentinel(It f, It l, const T & v) {
  // precondition: l can be dereferenced to store value as sentinel
  *l = v;
  while (*f != v) {
    ++f;
  }
  return f;
}
```

- Trick known in 1974/Knuth

# Detour: partition

![Image](../assets/2020-02-26-irregularity/07-partition.png)

---

# Partition semistable - toy code

```cpp
  template<typename It, typename Pred>
  // requires It is an ForwardIterator,
  //   Pred is an unary predicate on ValueType(It)
  It partition_semistable(It f, It l, Pred pred, Proj proj) {
    f = std::find_if(f, l, pred);
    if (f == l) return f;

    for (It i = std::next(f); i != l; ++i) {
      if(!pred(*i)) {
        std::iter_swap(f, i);
        ++f;
      }
    }
    return f;
  }
```

- NOTE: false range is first (EOP style, not std style)

---
class: large-points

# Partition - options

- Forward iterators - semistable
- Bidirectional iterators - faster
- Stable - more resources
- But can be implemented stable for list - the list iterators have something in
  common after all (partition_linked)
- The predicate is only applied once (or the algorithm spec should say otherwise)
- Position variations

---
class: large-points

# Algorithm naming quirks

- We only looked at a particular idiom (eager algorithms using first/last)
- There are a lot of algorithms (google "105 STL Algorithms in Less Than an Hour")
- There are subtle differences (e.g. between `accumulate` and `reduce` with
  regards to the associativity of the operation
- Leads to cognitive load
- A pragmatic solution: reduced vocabulary to repeatedly used algorithms in an
- A raw `for/while` loop is sometimes suitable, also more adaptable to changes
  area of code

---
class: large-points

# Concepts

- Specific: a particular way of implementing concepts in C++20 describing
  syntactic requirements (constraints)
- General: tool of thinking about requirements on types (not on values),
  especially relations between types.
- They (can) have a open/extensible character: not all concepts are orthogonal
  or hierarchical: the case of overlapping requirements identified after the type
  definition (especially important for built-in types)

---
class: large-points

# Concept naming quirks

- Non-intuitive synthetic names e.g. iterator, value type, sentinel, projection
  etc.
- Not derived mechanically: no mechanic nested concept propagation
- Based on observations on common behaviour
- They are invented, taste and choice matters
- Reduced vocabulary is a practical choice sometimes
- Another choice is customisation points e.g. `std::begin`
- Another practical choice is over-constraining to start with
- Hyperbolic usage conjecture applies to concepts
- Don't try to be too generic on custom/rarely used concepts

---
class: large-points

# Regular concept - for data

- Default constructible
- Copyable (and movable)
- Equality
- Destructible

```cpp
Some a;
a = b;
assert(a == b);
c = b;
assert(a == c);
```

- Fundamental behaviour, relied on for correctness reasoning
- Integer-like not in the addition/multiplication sense, but in the it holds a
  value that can be copied, compared for equality etc.
- e.g. standard containers

---
class: large-points

# Regular concept - for functions

- Arguments and return types are regular data types
- Replacing arguments with equal values results into equal return values
- Pure functions with no side effects, and no internal state like random number
  generators
- Can have side effects, but consistent results
- e.g. predicates for standard algorithms
- Different sounding definition compared with data regularity
- Same outcome: fundamental behaviour, relied on for correctness reasoning

---
class: large-points

# Irregularity continuum

- For almost every characteristic of a regular data concept, there are useful
  types that violate it

---
class: large-points

# Data irregularity examples

- Move: a bit weird - move an integer?
- Copy constructor throws - standard containers
- Default constructor throws - `std::list` (also what state?)
- Move constructor throws - `std::list`
- Destructor throws - scope exit idiom
- No default constructor - scope object type
- No copy - move only resource types
- Equality - of what? e.g. equality of remote content
- Equality complexity - worst case quadratic for unordered containers
- Equality for input iterator - does not make sense
- Float Nan equality `==` not `!=`
- **But** have not seen a sane case where `==` is different from not `!=`

---
class: large-points

# Function irregularity examples

- A lot of code is about side effects, order of operations matter - fully
  irregular
- Pseudo-regular - algorithms where the function only gets applied once per
  value - e.g. partition example

---
class: large-points

# Irregularity conjecture

- Generic data structures and algorithms are diverse, quirky and are not universal

--
- Reduced vocabulary is a pragmatic option of handling complexity
- Gains (efficiency/different behaviour) are available in special cases
- Either by using a more refined vocabulary
- Or by using human knowledge not available to the machine

---
class: large-points

# Things we know - examples

- Side effects are fine: pseudopredicate
- Can open file: running as root/administrator
- Sequence is sorted/ordered/partitioned for relation used: binary search can be used
- Relation is transitive for values provided
- `push_back()` won't throw: `vector` was previously resized
- Permutations can avoid invalidating the moved from objects
- Machines cover more ground, but there is always a gap
