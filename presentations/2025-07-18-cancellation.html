# Motivation

- This is in a way a continuation of the structured concurrency discussion
- We've seen that structured concurrency primitives like `when_any`,
  `when_all`, the ones involving timeouts etc. require cancellation support
- The topic of cancellation is complex enough that it deservers (at least) it's
  own separate presentation
- This explores using a variant of `std::stop_source|stop_token|stop_callback`
  like e.g. `std::inplace_stop_source|inplace_stop_token|inplace_stop_callback`
  that has the desired `noexcept` behaviour
  - will informally drop the `inplace_` prefix, but mean it
  - other single-threaded options are also possible for T1 threading models for
    example


- **Code is still slideware that demonstrates various specific issues, not
  production library quality code**

---

# Cancellation  at the leaves at chains

- could poll `stop_requested`
  - but that's unusual
- most register a stop callback
  - pattern to use in multi-threaded environments


- **Slideware aspect: awaiters in the following samples should be made
  non-copyable and non-moveable (same as say the sender/receiver operations)**

---

# async_noop

```cpp
co_await async_noop();
```

- noop continues immediately
- but if cancelled then it cancels the chain


- probably this is a rarely need to use primitive, but it has the advantage
  that the core code fits comfortably on a slide

---

# async_noop: poll

```cpp
struct noop_awaiter {
  context& ctx_;

  awaiter(context& ctx) noexcept :
    ctx_{ ctx }
  {}

  bool await_ready() const noexcept {
    return !ctx_.get_stop_token().stop_requested();
  }

  void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<>) noexcept {
    ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
  }

  constexpr void await_resume() const noexcept {
  }
};
```

- cancellation callback is scheduled, not called directly

---

# Cancellation is multistep

- cancellation is not a single step synchronous activity
- e.g. we've seen:

```cpp
ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
```

- we did not call directly the chain root cancellation callback then and there,
  but we deferred it via the re-schedule


- remember as we discussed in [callback, callback,
  callback](/presentations/2025-06-07-structured-concurrency.html) the term is
  unfortunately overloaded


---

# Cancellation is multistep

- we're on a leaf and either:
  - polling on the stop token `stop_requested()` returns true
  - a stop_callback is invoked (this is likely done on the caller of
    `request_stop()`
- in more complex cases than `noop` we need to call some C API to initiate
  cancellation, which will complete later
- but even in simple cases like `noop` we don't call the cancellation callback
  immediately we schedule later
- the cancellation callback will eventually do things like destroy the chain
- if we do that immediately:
  - we raise questions about stack size/overflow
  - lots of care is required because we destroy the very object (e.g.
    awaitable) that implements the stop_callback invocation
- therefore to avoid that, the cancellation is at least two steps:
  - the initiator calls `request_stop()` that leads to a tree of stop callbacks
    invokations for the leaves
  - this then returns
  - the actual cancellation callback indicating the completion of the
    cancellation work is called later (e.g. by the scheduler/run loop)

---

# async_yield

```cpp
co_await async_yield();
```

- give other chains a chance to run
- also cancel chain if cancelled

---

# async_yield: poll

```cpp
struct yield_awaiter {
  context& ctx_;

  awaiter(context& ctx) noexcept :
    ctx_{ ctx }
  {}

  constexpr bool await_ready() const noexcept {
    return false;
  }

  void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) noexcept {
    if (ctx_.get_stop_token().stop_requested()) {
      ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
      return;
    }

    ctx_.schedule_coroutine_resume(handle);
  }

  constexpr void await_resume() const noexcept {
  }
};
```

---

# async_suspend_forever

```cpp
co_await async_suspend_forever();
```

- suspends forever
- nothing is forever, can be cancelled
  - really "it's suspend until stopped because it's cancelled by something
    else"
  - name similar to other functions e.g. `serve_forever` for a Python socket
    server

---

# async_suspend_forever: callback

```cpp
struct suspend_forever_awaiter {
  context& ctx_;
  std::optional<stop_callback<callback>> stop_cb_;

  awaiter(context& ctx) noexcept :
    ctx_{ ctx }
  {}

  constexpr bool await_ready() const noexcept {
    return false;
  }

  void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<>) noexcept {
    configure_cancellation();
  }

  constexpr void await_resume() const noexcept {
  }
```
- notice the optional stop_callback
  - this is our single threaded stop_callback, but might be a
    `std::inplace_stop_callback`

---

# async_suspend_forever: callback

```cpp
private:
  void configure_cancellation() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.emplace(
      ctx_.get_stop_token(),
      make_member_callback<&awaiter::on_cancel>(this));
  }

  void on_cancel() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.reset();
    ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
  }
}; // suspend_forever_awaiter
```

- `std::optional<stop_callback<callback>> stop_cb_;` is used:
  - `emplace`: to register the callback (takes the `stop_token` and the actual
    callback)
  - to `reset()`: to unregister the callback (in this case once it's fired)

---

# stop_callback as a member

This is a common pattern that we've seen in the `suspend_forever_awaiter` where
we had a `std::optional<stop_callback<callback>> stop_cb_` as a member

This is different from the usual examples for `std::stop_token`:

```cpp
void in_some_function(std::stop_token st) {
  std::stop_callback cb(st, []() {
    // lambda body here
  });

  // do some stuff
}
```

In this example the size of the type of `cb` depends on the size of the
initializing lambda. But we can't use this pattern for a member variable where
the declaration is separated from the initialization (and the size needs to be
known at the declaration of the member variable).

For the `suspend_forever_awaiter` I used the trick that the `callback` has a
fixed size of two pointers.

# async_sleep_for

```cpp
co_await async_sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));
```

- sleeps for a specified duration
  - uses a node in a timer heap
- also cancels if cancelled
  - would not be efficient to poll for cancellation
  - uses stop callback to remove node from timer heap
