# Motivation

- This is in a way a continuation of the structured concurrency discussion
- We've seen that structured concurrency primitives like `when_any`,
  `when_all`, the ones involving timeouts etc. require cancellation support
- The topic of cancellation is complex enough that it deservers (at least) it's
  own separate presentation
- This explores using a variant of `std::stop_source|stop_token|stop_callback`
  like e.g. `std::inplace_stop_source|inplace_stop_token|inplace_stop_callback`
  that has the desired `noexcept` behaviour
  - will informally drop the `inplace_` prefix, but mean it
  - other single-threaded options are also possible for T1 threading models for
    example


- **Code is still slideware that demonstrates various specific issues, not
  production library quality code**

---

# Cancellation  at the leaves at chains

---

# Cancellation  at the leaves at chains

- could poll `stop_requested`
  - but that's unusual
- most register a stop callback
  - pattern to use in multi-threaded environments


- **Slideware aspect: awaiters in the following samples should be made
  non-copyable and non-moveable (same as say the sender/receiver operations)**

---

# async_noop

```cpp
co_await async_noop();
```

- noop continues immediately
- but if cancelled then it cancels the chain


- probably this is a rarely need to use primitive, but it has the advantage
  that the core code fits comfortably on a slide

---

# async_noop: poll

```cpp
struct noop_awaiter {
  context& ctx_;

  noop_awaiter(context& ctx) noexcept :
    ctx_{ ctx }
  {}

  bool await_ready() const noexcept {
    return !ctx_.get_stop_token().stop_requested();
  }

  void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<>) noexcept {
    ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
  }

  constexpr void await_resume() const noexcept {
  }
}; // noop_awaiter
```

- cancellation callback is scheduled, not called directly

---

# Cancellation is multistep

- e.g. we've seen:
```cpp
ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
```
- we did not call directly the chain root cancellation callback then and there,
  but we deferred it via the re-schedule


- remember as we discussed in [callback, callback,
  callback](/presentations/2025-06-07-structured-concurrency.html) the term is
  unfortunately overloaded


---

# Cancellation is multistep

- we're on a leaf and either:
  - polling on the stop token `stop_requested()` returns true
  - a stop_callback is invoked (this is likely done on the caller of
    `request_stop()`
- in more complex cases than `noop` we need to call some C API to initiate
  cancellation, which will complete later
- but even in simple cases like `noop` we don't call the cancellation callback
  immediately we schedule later
- the cancellation callback will eventually do things like destroy the chain
- if we do that immediately:
  - we raise questions about stack size/overflow
  - lots of care is required because we destroy the very object (e.g.
    awaitable) that implements the stop_callback invocation
- therefore to avoid that, the cancellation is at least two steps:
  - the initiator calls `request_stop()` that leads to a tree of stop callbacks
    invokations for the leaves
  - this then returns
  - the actual cancellation callback indicating the completion of the
    cancellation work is called later (e.g. by the scheduler/run loop)

---

# Cancellation is multistep

- cancellation is not a single step synchronous activity
- someone calls `request_stop()` e.g. on a `stop_token` or a `nursery`
  - that will initiate the cancellation (e.g. will often trigger work at the
    leaves of chains)
  - but (typically) it returns before the whole cancellation completes
- the cancellation is really completed when the `co_await` for the `wait_any`,
  `wait_all`, `nursery.async_run` etc. returns

---

# async_yield

```cpp
co_await async_yield();
```

- give other chains a chance to run
- also cancel chain if cancelled

---

# async_yield: poll

```cpp
struct yield_awaiter {
  context& ctx_;

  yield_awaiter(context& ctx) noexcept :
    ctx_{ ctx }
  {}

  constexpr bool await_ready() const noexcept {
    return false;
  }

  void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) noexcept {
    if (ctx_.get_stop_token().stop_requested()) {
      ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
      return;
    }

    ctx_.schedule_coroutine_resume(handle);
  }

  constexpr void await_resume() const noexcept {
  }
}; // yield_awaiter
```

---

# async_suspend_forever

```cpp
co_await async_suspend_forever();
```

- suspends forever
- nothing is forever, can be cancelled
  - really "it's suspend until stopped because it's cancelled by something
    else"
  - name similar to other functions e.g. `serve_forever` for a Python socket
    server

---

# async_suspend_forever: callback

```cpp
struct suspend_forever_awaiter {
  context& ctx_;
  std::optional<stop_callback<callback>> stop_cb_;

  suspend_forever_awaiter(context& ctx) noexcept :
    ctx_{ ctx }
  {}

  constexpr bool await_ready() const noexcept {
    return false;
  }

  void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<>) noexcept {
    configure_cancellation();
  }

  constexpr void await_resume() const noexcept {
  }
```
- notice the optional stop_callback
  - this is our single threaded stop_callback, but might be a
    `std::inplace_stop_callback`

---

# async_suspend_forever: callback

```cpp
private:
  void configure_cancellation() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.emplace(
      ctx_.get_stop_token(),
      make_member_callback<&suspend_forever_awaiter::on_cancel>(this));
  }

  void on_cancel() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.reset();
    ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
  }
}; // suspend_forever_awaiter
```

- `std::optional<stop_callback<callback>> stop_cb_;` is used:
  - `emplace`: to register the callback (takes the `stop_token` and the actual
    callback)
  - to `reset()`: to unregister the callback (in this case once it's fired)

---

# stop_callback as a member

This is a common pattern that we've seen in the `suspend_forever_awaiter` where
we had a `std::optional<stop_callback<callback>> stop_cb_` as a member

This is different from the usual examples for `std::stop_token`:

```cpp
void in_some_function(std::stop_token st) {
  std::stop_callback cb(st, []() {
    // lambda body here
  });

  // do some stuff
}
```

In this example the size of the type of `cb` depends on the size of the
initializing lambda. But we can't use this pattern for a member variable where
the declaration is separated from the initialization (and the size needs to be
known at the declaration of the member variable).

For the `suspend_forever_awaiter` I used the trick that the `callback` has a
fixed size of two pointers.

---

# stop_callback as a member

```cpp
struct suspend_forever_awaiter {
  context& ctx_;
  std::optional<stop_callback<callback>> stop_cb_;
  // ...
  void configure_cancellation() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.emplace(
      ctx_.get_stop_token(),
      make_member_callback<&suspend_forever_awaiter::on_cancel>(this));
  }

  void on_cancel() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.reset();
    ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
  }
}; // suspend_forever_awaiter
```
- instead of this you'll more likely to see ...

---

# stop_callback as a member

```cpp
struct suspend_forever_awaiter {
  struct cancel_cb {
    suspend_forever_awaiter& awaiter_;
    void operator()() noexcept {
      awaiter_.on_cancel();
    }
  };

  context& ctx_;
  std::optional<stop_callback<cancel_cb>> stop_cb_;
  // ...
  void configure_cancellation() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.emplace(
      ctx_.get_stop_token(),
      cancel_cb{this});
  }

  void on_cancel() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.reset();
    ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
  }
}; // suspend_forever_awaiter
```

---

# async_sleep_for

```cpp
co_await async_sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));
```

- sleeps for a specified duration
  - uses a node in a timer heap
- also cancels if cancelled
  - would not be efficient to poll for cancellation
  - uses stop callback to remove node from timer heap

---

# async_sleep_for (1/3)

```cpp
struct spleep_awaiter {
  context& ctx_;
  timer_node timer_node_;
  std::coroutine_handle<> parent_handle_;
  std::optional<stop_callback<callback>> stop_cb_;

  sleep_awaiter(context& ctx, std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point deadline) noexcept :
    ctx_{ ctx },
    timer_node_{ deadline }
  {}

  constexpr bool await_ready() const noexcept {
    return false;
  }

  void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) noexcept {
    parent_handle_ = handle;
    schedule_timer();
  }

  constexpr void await_resume() const noexcept {
  }
```

---

# async_sleep_for (2/3)

```cpp
private:
  void schedule_timer() noexcept {
    timer_node_.cb = make_member_callback<&sleep_awaiter::on_timer>(this);
    ctx_.insert_timer_node(timer_node_);
    stop_cb_.emplace(
      ctx_.get_stop_token(),
      make_member_callback<&sleep_awaiter::on_cancel>(this));
  }
```

- notice that when we actually do some work (e.g. `insert_timer_node`), that is
  an additional step from creating the callback via `stop_cb_.emplace`, raising
  questions like: What happens if the timer fires before we call
  `stop_cb_.emplace()`? Is the order right, should we emplace and then insert?
  etc.
  - this is a toy example that works for a T1 threading model where the timer
    can't fire until we return to the run loop
  - will discuss later what to do in a multi-threaded model

---

# async_sleep_for (3/3)

```cpp
  void on_timer() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.reset();

    parent_handle_.resume();
  }

  void on_cancel() noexcept {
    stop_cb_.reset();
    ctx_.remove_timer_node(timer_node_);
    ctx_.schedule_cancellation_callback();
  }
}; //sleep_awaiter
```

- note that `parent_handle_.resume()` is fine to be called without stack
  overflow risks as `on_timer` is called close to the run loop

---

# Call API, no cancellation

```cpp
struct api_awaiter {
  std::coroutine_handle<> parent_handle_;
  // ...

  constexpr bool await_ready() const noexcept {
    return false;
  }

  void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) noexcept {
    parent_handle_ = handle;
    // call C API e.g. AsyncFileRead
  }

  int await_resume() const noexcept {
    // return result
  }
}; // api_awaiter
```

---

# Call API, no cancellation

- [As shown
  here](https://lewissbaker.github.io/2017/11/17/understanding-operator-co-await)
  a C API that starts concurrent behaviour can be done without any synchronization
  - **if cancellation is not implemented by the awaiter/operatation**
- The issue is that when calling a C API that starts concurrent behaviour, then
  another thread can do concurrent work e.g. the C API callback and resume the
  coroutine which will continue from `await_resume` in that other thread
  - even before the C API returns in `await_suspend`
  - and the `resume()` could then even destroy the awaiter/operation while
    `await_suspend` is in progress
- But that can be made to work if done carefully:
  - because the coroutine is suspended when the C API is called, then resume
    has the correct state to resume from
  - if care is taken to not access members of the awaiter after the C API is
    called (by accessing the before, as done for `parent_handle_` in the
    example, or by storing copies on the stack of `await_suspend`


- Also things are easier if cancellation is implemented, but we do not run in a
  multithreaded model (e.g. the timer example running in a T1 model)

---

# Call API, multithreaded

- But what to do in a multithreaded model?
- The issue is that
  - if calling a C API like `WSARecv`
  - we have to emplace the stop_callback optional
  - but that requires accessing a member of the awaiter/operation
  - while potentially the C API callback is called from another thread
- See [P2300 1.4. Asynchronous Windows socket
  recv](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r10.html#example-async-windows-socket-recv)
  where they solve this problem for a sender/receiver operation
  - the idea is around using an atomic bool

---

# Call API, multithreaded

```cpp
struct api_awaiter : derived from WSAOVERLAPPED {
  // ...
  std::atomic<bool> ready_{false};
  // ...

  std::coroutine_handle<> await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) noexcept {
    parent_handle_ = handle;
    // call WSAReceive, or even call it in await_ready instead
    if (result_io_pending) {
      stop_cb_.emplace(...);
      if (ready_.exchange(true, std::memory_order_acq_rel)) {
        // handle completion here e.g stop_cb_.reset() ...
      }
    }
  }

  void on_c_api_callback() {
    if (ready_.exchange(true, std::memory_order_acq_rel)) {
      // handle completion here e.g stop_cb_.reset() ...
    }
  }
}; // api_awaiter
```

---

# Exchange logic

In the toy example I used just `exchange` to mark completion:
```cpp
if (ready_.exchange(true, std::memory_order_acq_rel)) {
  // ...
}
```

This caters for the scenario where there are potentially two threads. First
thread calls a C API, taking a C callback e.g. `WSAReceive`, then it needs to
do some work emplacing an optional called `stop_cb_`. Then it will set `ready_`
via `exchange`, see the initial value of `false` and not execute the block.

Then (usually) another thread runs the C callback that sees `true` out the
exchange and does execute the block that accesses `stop_cb_` (calling
`.reset()`).

If the timing is different the C callback thread might skip the `if` block and
the work will be done by the first thread.

But in production you'll do a variation of the code above.

---

# Load and exchange

[P2300, the "1.4. Asynchronous Windows socket recv"
example](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r10.html#example-async-windows-socket-recv)
uses a slightly different pattern to mark completion equivalent to:

```cpp
if (ready_.load(std::memory_order_acquire) ||
    ready_.exchange(true, std::memory_order_acq_rel)) {
  // ...
}
```

As far as I can see the option to do just `exchange` is sufficient, but both
threads will do an `exchange`. With the option `load` followed by `exchange`:
typically there will be a `load` and `exchange` from one thread and only a
`load` from the other (though it might be that both threads to `load` and
`exchange`).

This choice [seems to be an
optimisation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79717187/why-load-and-exchange-an-stdatomicbool)
on the lines of [test and
tests-and-set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_and_test-and-set) (the idea
is `exchange` is expensive).

There could also be the option to do just `exchange` on the code path calling
the C API and load+exchange from the C callback.
