# Motivation

- This is in a way a continuation of the structured concurrency discussion
- We've seen that structured concurrency primitives like `when_any`,
  `when_all`, the ones involving timeouts etc. require cancellation support
- The topic of cancellation is complex enough that it deservers (at least) it's
  own separate presentation
- This explores using a variant of `std::stop_source|stop_token|stop_callback`
  like e.g. `std::inplace_stop_source|inplace_stop_token|inplace_stop_callback`
  that has the desired `noexcept` behaviour
  - will informally drop the `inplace_` prefix, but mean it
  - other single-threaded options are also possible for T1 threading models for
    example
