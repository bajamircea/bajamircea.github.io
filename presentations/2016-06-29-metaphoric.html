# Metaphoric programming

---

# What is a metaphor

"My love is like a rose"

--

- this is NOT a metaphor, it's a simile
- "is like", but not the same thing

--

"My love is a rose"

- this IS a metaphor
- the comparison is no longer explicit

--

When faced with a metaphor, we can

- underreact: "yep, whatever", and move on
- overreact: "that's a strange thing to say, the author could not have meant
  that" "so then he must have elided the comparison" "let's understand to what
  degree the comparison stands, and where it does not"
- really understand: "duh! it's a metaphor"

---

# Agenda

I'm going to illustrate the same metaphor mechanics in programming

--

We'll look at very simple (mostly C++) code samples that are like, but not quite the same
thing, as what they appear to be

```cpp
severity > 2
```

```cpp
wait_for(10s)
```

```cpp
std::move(a)
```

---

# Logger

### Requirements

- print log messages
- messages have severity 1 to 4
- only print errors (severity 4) and warnings (severity 3)


--


- only print if severity is greater than 2

---

### Possible solution

```cpp
void log(int severity, const char * message)
{
  if (severity > 2)
  {
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
  }
}

int main()
{
  log(1, "debug message");
  log(2, "verbose message");
  log(3, "warning message");
  log(4, "error message");
}
```

---

### Possible solution

```cpp
void log(int severity, const char * message)
{
  if (severity > 2)
  {
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
  }
}

int main()
{
  log(1, "debug message");
  log(2, "verbose message");
* log(3, "warning message");
* log(4, "error message");
}
```

Outputs

```
warning message
error message
```

---

### Possible solution

```cpp
void log(int severity, const char * message)
{
* if (severity > 2)
  {
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
  }
}

int main()
{
  log(1, "debug message");
  log(2, "verbose message");
  log(3, "warning message");
  log(4, "error message");
}
```

- "severity" is an "int"
- "severity > 2" evaluates to "bool"

---

### Another solution

```cpp
int main()
{
  logger log{ severity > 2 };

  log(1, "debug messsage");
  log(2, "verbose message");
  log(3, "warning message");
  log(4, "error message");
}
```

Outputs

```
warning message
error message
```

--

Underreaction

- it's just like the other one, right?

---

### Another solution

```cpp
int main()
{
* logger log{ severity > 2 };

  log(1, "debug messsage");
  log(2, "verbose message");
  log(3, "warning message");
  log(4, "error message");
}
```

--

Overreaction. It's not like the first example

- "log" is not a function, it's a variable
- its type is "logger"
- "severity > 2" is not a evaluated to a boolean
- "severity" is not an int
- so how does this work?

---

### Another solution

```cpp
*class logger
{
public:
  explicit logger(
*   std::function<bool(int, const char *)> filter) :
    filter_{ filter }
  {
  }

  void operator()(int s, const char * message)
  {
*   if(filter_(s, message))
    {
      std::cout << message << std::endl;
    }
  }
private:
  std::function<bool(int, const char *)> filter_;
};
```

"logger" is a class that needs a function to filter messages

---

### Another solution

```cpp
*std::function<int(int, const char *)> severity =
[](int s, const char *)
{
  return s;
};

*std::function<bool(int, const char*)> operator > (
  std::function<int(int, const char *)> fn,
  int level)
{
  return [=](int s, const char * message) -> bool
  {
*   return fn(s, message) > level;
  };
};
```

"severity" is a function

---

# Give up after a timeout

### Requirements

- start operation
- detect (and give up) if operation did not complete in 10 seconds

---

### Possible solutions

```cpp
std::condition_variable cv;
...
*if(! cv.wait_for(lk, 10s, [&op](){ return op.is_complete(); }))
{
  // timed out
}
```

---

### Possible solutions

```cpp
std::condition_variable cv;
...
if(! cv.wait_for(lk, 10s, [&op](){ return op.is_complete(); }))
{
  // timed out
}
```

```cpp
std::future<result> f = ...;
...
*if(std::future_status::timeout ==  f.wait_for(10s))
{
  // timed out
}
```

---

### Possible solutions

```cpp
std::condition_variable cv;
...
if(! cv.wait_for(lk, 10s, [&op](){ return op.is_complete(); }))
{
  // timed out
}
```

```cpp
std::future<result> f = ...;
...
if(std::future_status::timeout ==  f.wait_for(10s))
{
  // timed out
}
```

When "wait_for" is evaluated, we either

- have a result for the operation (before the time-out interval)
- or it times-out

---

### Another solution

Sample code from N4045

```cpp
error_code ec;
size_t n = async_read(
  socket,
  buffer,
* block.wait_for(10s)[ec]));
```

--

When "wait_for" is evaluated, it does not really wait (it would wait before we
start the operation inside "async_read" and that would be silly)

--

Instead it returns a completion token which is used inside async_read to
actually wait for the specified interval

--

It's a metaphor again!

---

# Move

### Requirements

- move an entity
- from a source to a destination

---

### Possible solutions

Move a file (using bash)

```bash
mv src.txt dst.txt
```

--

Move a value (42) into a register (r12) (using assembly)

```asm
mov r12, #0x2a
```

--

So the pattern for a move operation is:

- specify source and destination as arguments
- destination might the first argument, not the second

---

### Another solution

```cpp
std::move(a)
```

--

Underreact
- yeah, so what?

--

Overreact

- so "std::move" has two arguments (source and destination) and when
it returns the contents of the source has been moved to the destination
- oh, no! it only has one argument
- oh, no! "std::move" does not move

--

It's a metaphor again!

- "std::move" is just a static cast to a rvalue reference (an xvalue in
  particular)
