# History of normal type in C++

---
# Regular data

```cpp
struct person
{
  std::string first_name;
  std::string last_name;
  int age{};

  constexpr std::strong_ordering
    operator<=>(const person &) const noexcept = default;
};
```

# Agenda

- struct from C
- C copy
- C++ constructor, destructor, copy, const
- C++ equality and order (first attempt)
- move
- STL and the regularity concept
- concepts in C++
- regularity syntax and semantics
- the many relationships
- three-way comparison, aka the spaceship operator
- better equality
- better member
- noexcept and constexpr
- sanity and divergence from insanity
- the better future

# Questions?

---
class: large-points

# Regular data concept (syntax)

- default constructible (noexcept)
- destructible (implicitly noexcept)
- copy constructor and assignment (can throw)
- move constructor and assignment (noexcept)
- equality (== and !=, noexcept, const)
- order (<, >, <=, >=, <=>, noexcept, const)

---
class: large-points

# Concept also has semantics

- "it's a data class"
- copy copies, move moves, etc.
- no resource/memory leaks
- copies are equal, substitutable
- "moved from" at least can be destroyed and assigned
- equality reflexive, symmetric, transitive
- != is literally "not equal"
- less than is strict total order
- trichotomy
- reasonable complexity of operations
