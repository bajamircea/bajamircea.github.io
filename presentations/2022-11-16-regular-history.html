# struct from C

```cpp
struct sample
{
  int w; // 4 bytes
  char x; // 1 byte
  // 3 bytes of padding here
  int y; // 4 bytes
  char z; // 1 byte
  // 3 bytes of padding at the end
}; // takes overall 16 bytes
```

- padding can be reduced by sorting members by size
- such a type provides interpretation of memory

---
# C copy motivation

```cpp
// can do this if x and y are int,
x = y;
// what if they are some struct?
```

```cpp
// can do this if x is int,
int foo(int x);
// what if they are some struct?
struct sample bar(struct sample y);
```

- initially the answer was: NO
- eventually the answer was: YES

---
# C copy

```cpp
// to initialize:
void * memset(void * ptr, int value, size_t num);

// to copy:
void * memcpy(void * dest, const void * src, size_t num);

// to move:
void * memmove(void * dest, const void * src, size_t num);

// to compare:
int memcmp(const void * ptr1, const void * ptr2, size_t num);
```

---
# C copy

- uses `memcpy` to copy
- but can't use `memcmp` to compare because of padding

```cpp
// can do this if x and y are int,
if (x &lt; y) {
  // ...
}
// but can't do it if they are some struct
```

---
# C++ class

```cpp
struct foo {

  // member variable
  int bar;

  // member function
  void buzz() {
    // member function body
    bar = 42;
    // or
    this->bar = 42;
  }
};
```

- `class` is the same as `struct` except default visibility
   which is private for the `class`

---
# C++ constructor/destructor

```cpp
struct foo {

  // constructor
  foo() {
    // constructor body
  }

  // destructor
  // "not constructor"
  ~foo() {
    // destructor body
  }
};
```
---
# C++ copy motivation

```cpp
struct foo {
  bar * ptr;

  foo() {
    // allocate memory here
  }

  ~foo() {
    // deallocate memory here
  }
};
```

```cpp
int main() {
  foo x; // memory is allocated here
  foo y = x; // y gets a copy of the pointer value
  // memory freed twice: ups!
}
```

---
# C++ copy

```cpp
struct foo {
  bar * ptr;

  foo(const foo & other) {
    // copy construct here
    // e.g. allocate memory pointed by ptr
    // then copy bar from *(other.ptr)
  }

  foo & operator=(const foo & other) {
    // copy assignment here
    // needs to handle the case where
    // ptr already points to something
    return *this;
  }
};
```

- `const` and reference
- reference vs. `this`
- constructor and assignment: efficiency

---
# Self assignment, identity

```cpp
int main() {
  foo x;
  x = x; // self assignment
}
```

Options:
- don't self assign
- handle it

```cpp
  foo & operator=(const foo & other) {
    if (this != &other) {
      // actual copy assignment here
    }
    return *this;
  }
```

---
# Non-copyable

```cpp
  foo(const foo & other) = delete;
  foo & operator=(const foo & other) = delete;
```

---
# Copy means copy

- return value optimisations

```cpp
foo buzz() {
  return foo();
  // foo is default constructed
  // and then copied into the return value
}

int main() {
  foo x = buzz();
  // the return value of buzz is copied into x
}
```

---
# Exception safety

- basic: does not leak
- does not throw: noexcept
- strong (rollback) guarantee

---
# C++ comparison: first try

```cpp
class foo {
  // ...
public:
  bool operator==(const foo & other) const {
    // compare *this with other
    // return true if equal
    // return false otherwise
  }

  // ...
};
```

```cpp
  // assuming a and b are of type foo
  // operator == is called here
  // *this is a, other is b
  if (a == b) {
    // ...
  }
```

- motivation: complex number class

---
# Heterogenous: first try

```cpp
class foo {
  // ...
public:
  bool operator==(const char * other) {
    // compare *this with literal string
  }

  // ...
};
```

- motivation: std::string

```cpp
  if (a == "test") {
    // ...
  }
  // but this does not work
  if ("test" == a) {
    // ...
  }
```

---
# Friend trick

```cpp
class foo {
  // ...
public:
  friend bool operator==(const foo & x, const char * y) {
    // compare x with y
    // return true if equal
    // return false otherwise
  }

  // ...
};
```

---
# Similar

Equality functions:
```cpp
bool operator!=(const foo & x, const foo & y) {
  return !(x == y);
}
```

Order functions:
```cpp
bool operator<=(const foo & x, const foo & y) {
  return !(y < x);
}
bool operator>(const foo & x, const foo & y) {
  return y < x;
}
bool operator>=(const foo & x, const foo & y) {
  return !(x < y);
}
```

# STL

```cpp
#define private public
```
- macros
- templates
- STL (Alex Stepanov)


- "What is an iterator? Not a class. Not a type. It is a concept. […] It is
  something which doesn’t have a linguistic incarnation in C++. But it could."
- The regular concept arouse from questions like: “if you design a vector as a
  resizable array container, what types should the vector template accept?”

---
# C++ move motivation

```cpp
  // written like this swap makes unnecessary copies
  foo tmp = a; // copy constructor
  a = b;       // copy assignment
  b = tmp;     // copy assignment
  // end result: three deep copies
```

---
# C++ move

```cpp
class foo {
  bar * ptr;
public:
  // ...

  foo(foo && other) : ptr{ other.ptr } noexcept {
    other.ptr = nullptr;
  }

  foo & operator=(foo && other) noexcept {
    if (this != &other) {
      delete ptr; // asumes bar destructor does not throw
      ptr = other.ptr;
      other.ptr = nullptr;
    }
    return *this;
  }
};
```

- `noexcept` and move

---
# C++ move

```cpp
  T tmp = std::move(a); // move constructor
  a = std::move(b);     // move assignment
  b = std::move(tmp);   // move assignment
  // end result: three ownership transfers
```

- "moved from" state: destroy or assign
- destructive vs. non-destructive

---
# Regular data concept (semantics)

- It's a data class.
- You can create an instance of that class
- You can destroy an instance of that class
- It does not leak resources, it does not leak memory in particular, that's the
  only kind of resource you would expect such a type to acquire, the destructor
  in particular takes care of releasing the resources
- You can take a copy (either by assignment or construction)
- You can move it (also either by assignment or construction)
- Move is an optimised version of copy for when the original is no longer
  needed
- "moved from" can at least be destroyed and assigned
- You can test two instances for equality `==`
- It does not matter how we compare for equality: `!=` is not equal, the
  opposite of equal
- Equality behaves properly: reflexive, symmetric, transitive, substitutable
- A copy is equal to the original
- ...

---
# Regular data concept (semantics)

- ...
- You can compare two instances for order
- It does not matter how we compare for order: can use either of `<`, `>`,
  `<=`, `>=`, `<=>`. E.g. `a < b` is the same as `b > a`
- Less than `<` behaves properly, it is strict total order: irreflexive,
  asymmetric, transitive. Similarly the other order functions.
- Equality works properly with order. Trichotomy: either `a < b` or `a == b` or
  `b < a`
- Equality and comparison do not change the arguments, copy does not change the
  source.
- Of all the functions above, only copy might throw (because it might need to
  allocate memory)
- The functions above have reasonable complexity of operations: constant or at
  most linear with the amount of data held
- Independence: changing one value does not change other unrelated values

# Regular data concept (syntax)

- Default constructor (`noexcept`)
- Destructor (implicitly `noexcept`)
- Copy constructor and assignment
- Move constructor and assignment (`noexcept`)
- Equality: `==` and `!=` (`noexcept` and `const`)
- Order: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `<=>` (`noexcept` and `const`)

# C++20 concepts

- idea from Alex Stepanov (see STL/EOP)
- but even C had such an idea e.g. `short`, `int`, `long` are all signed
  integers
- going all the way to the genus (from the ancient Greeks)


- `requires` expression

```cpp
requires (T x) { x + x; }
```

---
# C++20 concepts

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept addable = requires(T x) { x + x; };
```

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept small_addable = addable<T> && (sizeof(T) <= 4);
```

???
>

---
# C++20 concepts

- `requires` clause

```cpp
template<typename T>
T add(T x, T y)
  requires addable<T>
{
  return x + y;
}
```

```cpp
template<addable T>
T add(T x, T y)
{
  return x + y;
}
```

---
# C++20 concepts

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept incrementable = requires (T x) { ++x; x++; };

auto add_one(incrementable auto x)
{
  return ++x;
}
```

- `requires` clause, then `requires` expression

```cpp
template<typename T>
T add(T x, T y)
  requires requires(T x) { x + x; }
{
  return x + y;
}
```

---
# C++20 concepts

- they are just a tool: like `struct` (does not tell you how to use it)
- e.g. used for `std::ranges`
- errors not necessarily shorter
- `std::regular` concept was demonetized from the "regular" concept

---
# Many relationships

- homogeneous/heterogeneous
- predicate: returns `bool`
- total/partial: domain
- identity, equality, equivalence
- "less than" trichotomy with equality
- weak order trichotomy with equivalence


- the weird case of `float`: NaN and -0.0

---
# Spaceship operator

- this: `<=>`
- not: `>=< >-< |=| |-o-| <o>`


- three-way comparison (see `memcmp`)
- `= default`
- simplifies symmetric heterogeneous comparisons


- debatable:

```
                <- partial_ordering
 weak_equality           ^
                <-  weak_ordering
       ^                 ^
strong_equality <- strong_ordering
```

- the efficiency of equality

# Pragmatic spaceship

```cpp
struct person {
  std::string first_name;
  std::string last_name;
  int age{};

  constexpr std::strong_ordering
    operator<=>(const person &) const noexcept = default;
};
```

# Good regulars

- `int`: the dream regular type.
- `std::string`: copy could throw, but that's usually OK, all dynamically
  allocated containers have this issue.
- `std::vector`: it is regular if the `value_type` is regular (it does
  lexicographical compare, which is what one would expect), but not if the
  `value_type` is not regular. It still makes sense to be able to store
  contiguously items, even if not regular.
- `std::pair`: similar issues with the vector, it all depends on member types.
  It does memberwise compare, which is what one would expect.
- `std::optional`: orders the `nullopt` value ahead of the underlying
  `value_type` order. That's OK.
- `std::shared_ptr`: does shallow copy and comparison, but that OK, it uses
  atomics to address expectations around threading.

---
# Wannabes

- Types like `std::map` in the Microsoft implementation that might throw for
  default constructor or move constructor, but are otherwise OK. They might
  also not have caught fully with `constexpr` support.
- Types like `std::unordered_map` where the equality time complexity might be
  `N^2`, but are otherwise OK. Maybe you say that those cases are outside the
  domain of equality comparison
- Types like `float` have multiple issues around `NaN` (domain issues) and
  `-0.0`/`+0.0` (`==` does not mean equality)
- Types like `string_view` which are not semantically regular e.g. you take a
  copy, you change the original string, but then it's still equal to the
  original (because it's a view to the same data). Because it's a constant view
  into data, it just about gets away with doing a shallow copy, but a deep
  compare.
- `span` unlike `string_view` also does a shallow copy of the pointers and
  determine the range, but does not get away with doing a deep compare
- Then the standard relaxed the requirements further where the `std::regular`
  concept does not require order. E.g. C++ iterators; note though they could
  have had order, it's just that order for two iterators would reflect the
  location in memory, not in the sequence (think pointers to nodes in a linked
  list), and some would find that confusing.
- And then further relaxed for `std::semiregular` to not even have equality
- ...

---
# Wannabes

- ...
- vtable interface based types that use `clone` methods to copy, with their own issues
  around comparisons
- Types that can't be copied like RAII C-handle wrappers, but can be moved
- Types that aren't even meant to be moved or copied like trait types: they are
  just some syntactic mechanism to communicate with the compiler.

**Some deviations from regular are meant to be, but others are caused by poor
design.**

In particular using `==` and `<` to mean less than equality and "less than"
(pun intended) is wrong. Define instead methods like `is_equivalent` or
`preceeds` and use those to customise algorithms.
