# On coding style

---

# On general writing style

"The Elements of Style" by William Strunk and E. B. White:
<blockquote>
Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.
</blockquote>

"Clear and simple as the truth: writing classic prose" by
Francis-Noël Thomas and Mark Turner:

<blockquote>
A style is defined by it's conceptual stand on truth, presentation, writer,
reader, thought, language, and their relationship 
</blockquote>

---

# Data

```json
{
  "name": "Kipper",
  "breed": "Labrador"
}
```

---

# OOP style

```cpp
class dog {
private:
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> name_;
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> breed_;

public:
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> get_name() {
    return name_;
  }
  void set_name(std::shared_ptr<std::string> value) {
    name_ = value;
  }
  std::shared_ptr<std::string> get_breed() {
    return breed_;
  }
  void set_breed(std::shared_ptr<std::string> value) {
    breed_ = value;
  }
  void init(const Json & doc) {
    name_ = doc.get_string("name");
    breed_ = doc.get_string("breed");
  }
};
```

---

# Lambda style

```cpp
void dog_from_json(
  std::function<std::string(const char * key)> property,
  std::function<const std::string & name, const std::string & breed> callback)
{
  callback(property("name"), property("breed"));
}

[&doc]() {
  std::string name;
  std::string breed;
  dog_from_json([&doc](const char * key) {
    return doc.get_string(key);
  }, [&] (const std::string & name_, const std::string & breed_) {
    name = name_;
    breed = breed_;
  });
  // use name and breed here ...
} ();
```
---

# Classic style

```cpp
struct dog
{
  std::string name;
  std::string breed;
};

dog dog_from_json(const Json & doc)
{
  return { doc.get_string("name"), doc.get_string("breed") };
}
```

---

# Consequences

![Image](/assets/2018-07-06-on-coding-style/02-classic-layout.png)

---

# Performance style

```cpp
void dog_from_json(char * json_buffer, char ** name, char ** breed)
{
  // gets a non-const buffer of characters and will point name and breed
  // to values in the buffer
}
```

# On styles

There are a multitude of coding styles (but some are better than others)

They are defined by
- attitudes to truth
- representation
- abstraction usage
- generality
- relation between the writer and reader.

---

# Classic style

- assumes there is one true, identifiable representation
- that the right representation needs to be chosen (e.g. objects vs. functions)
- uses abstractions as necessary
- aims for a certain generality and elegance
- simplicity hides the effort to achieve it


---

# Superficial elements

Indentation and tab wars.

Notice the similarity between the first rule in "The Elements of Style":

<blockquote>
Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's. [...] Exceptions are the
possessive of ancient proper names ending in -es and is, [...]
</blockquote>

and the first rule in the "Google C++ Style Guide":

<blockquote>
In general, every .cc file should have an associated .h file. There are some
common exceptions, such as unittests and small .cc files containing just a
main() function.
</blockquote>
